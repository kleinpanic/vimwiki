# HPA-Meeting

## Potential Minor: 
- Adaptive Brain and Behavior 
    - They do not care about a minor, do what you enjoy because you will convey that. You can't do what they think they want, you can only do what you want to do. 
- Comp Sci minor (She likes)
    - If i enjoy it it can be applied
    - Do not DISMISS
    - Secondary skills are attractive to med schools
- Its all about what you get from the things you do. 

## ToDo
- Set time aside for MCAT
- Push GPA for 4.0 as much as possible
- Take it next year.
- They want to get to know you, talk to admissions before sending stuff. 
- avoid postpack
- DO would be easier, MD would be harder
- if you can show them you got serious, they will take you more serious. 
- Join chats / blogs, visit the meds schools, they will give you resources, meet students of the med school, let them know ur serious. 
## Resources:
- Caplin reviews
- Princton reviews(Ask admissions, ask about scholarships, reviews, be upfront) 
- Do practice interviews (Small group interviews)
    - HPA-HUB (look at calander) 
    - HPEK (Need a 3.2)
