# NCURSES / Curses
## Introduction
- Curses is a terminal control library for Unix-like systems, enabling the construction of text-user interface (TUI) applications. 
- The name is a pun on the term "cursor optimization". It is a library of functions that manage an application's display on character-cell terminals. 
- ncurses (new curses) is a programming library providing an application programming interface (API) that allows writing TUIs in a computer terminal-independent manner. It is a toolkit for developing graphical using interface(GUI)-like application software that runs from under a terminal emulator. It also optimizes screen changes, to reduce the latency experienced when using remote shells. 
  - ncurses is a free and open-source software emulation of the System V Release 4.0 curses.
