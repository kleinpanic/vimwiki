A **Kernel Module for Process Monitoring** can be a powerful tool for security auditing, system monitoring, and performance analysis. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the idea and potential enhancements:

---

### **Project Overview**
This project involves developing a **Loadable Kernel Module (LKM)** that hooks into process management functions to log and monitor process activity. It will provide real-time insights into process creation, termination, and potential suspicious behavior.

---

### **Core Features**
1. **Process Creation Logging**
   - Hooks into `do_fork()` or `task_newtask()`
   - Logs process ID (PID), parent PID (PPID), and executable path
   - Captures user ID (UID) of the process owner

2. **Process Termination Logging**
   - Hooks into `do_exit()` to capture when a process exits
   - Logs exit code and runtime duration
   - Identifies whether the termination was normal or due to a signal

3. **Suspicious Behavior Detection**
   - Flags rapid process creation (e.g., potential fork bomb)
   - Detects execution of files from `/tmp` (common malware behavior)
   - Identifies execution of unusual binaries (like shell scripts running in `/dev/shm/`)

4. **Userland Interface**
   - Uses `procfs` (`/proc/process_monitor`) or `sysfs` for logging
   - Outputs logs to **dmesg** or a separate **ring buffer**
   - Can be configured to send alerts to `syslog`

5. **Configuration Options**
   - Enable/disable monitoring for specific users or processes
   - Set thresholds for "suspicious" process behavior (e.g., X processes per second)

---

### **Potential Enhancements**
#### **1. Advanced Event Tracking**
- **Intercept execve() calls** to track execution of new binaries.
- **Monitor privilege escalations** (e.g., `setuid` binaries, `sudo` executions).
- **Detect hidden processes** using `sysctl` tricks (similar to a rootkit approach).

#### **2. Integration with Other Security Mechanisms**
- **Attach to SELinux/AppArmor profiles** to cross-reference security policies.
- **Integrate with a BPF program** to provide lightweight, flexible monitoring.
- **Notify a user-space daemon** that can apply security policies dynamically.

#### **3. Network Activity Correlation**
- **Track network-bound processes** (e.g., identify malware launching outbound connections).
- **Monitor connections from newly spawned processes** (e.g., detect reverse shells).
- **Log TCP/UDP ports opened by processes** in real-time.

#### **4. Performance Monitoring**
- **Capture CPU and memory usage** per process at creation and termination.
- **Identify high-frequency spawns** that might indicate inefficient scripts or bugs.
- **Log disk I/O and network I/O** per process for deeper analysis.

#### **5. Process Behavior Analysis**
- **Mark "orphan" processes** left by killed parents.
- **Monitor zombie processes** (`defunct` processes) and alert if they exceed a threshold.
- **Detect user-mode rootkits** by checking for overwritten syscalls.

---

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Language**: C (Kernel Module)
- **Hooking Methods**:
  - `kprobe` for attaching to system calls (`sys_execve`, `sys_exit`, etc.)
  - `LSM hooks` (Linux Security Module API) for security-based monitoring
  - `BPF hooks` for lightweight event tracking
- **Output Mechanisms**:
  - `/proc` or `/sysfs` for direct user-space access
  - Kernel ring buffer (`dmesg` or `tracepoints`)
  - Netlink sockets for real-time event streaming to user-space

---

### **Use Cases**
1. **Forensics & Incident Response** â€“ Analyze process behavior during security breaches.
2. **Malware Detection** â€“ Identify suspicious execution patterns in real-time.
3. **System Optimization** â€“ Detect inefficient scripts that spawn excessive processes.
4. **Kernel-Level Security** â€“ Prevent privilege escalation or unauthorized code execution.
5. **Container Security** â€“ Monitor process activity inside containers for suspicious actions.
