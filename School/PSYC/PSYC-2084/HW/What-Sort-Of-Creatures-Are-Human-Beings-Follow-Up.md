## Follow Up Activity. 

### Assignment Instructions / Details: 

Skim the first supplemental reading of the semester entitled, 'Social Psychologists and Thinking about People.'. Refamiliarize yourself with the 'images' of humankind that are presented in the paper. 
After that, note which combinations you think best characterizes us and list them. Do this before examining your selections from the beginning of the semester.
Again note which combination of images you now think best characterizes us before examining your selection from beginning of the semester. Find your original paper, note which images you selected at the beginning of the semester.
Write a brief response summarizing:
Why you think your selections changed (or did not) given information/topics we discussed in the course (e.g., ‘My first response was that we [humans] are primarily A-image, B-image, and C-image. Now, I think we are … [insert the same or changed images] … due to our class discussions of/learning about X, Y, and/or Z. Our discussions of/learning about X, Y, and/or Z changed my mind (or did not), because…’. A brief paragraph (some thoughtful sentences) describing your reasoning is expected.

### Assignment Submission: 

#### Current Image-set of HumanKind. 

After re-reading Baumeister's essay, the three portrayals that now seem most diagnostic are the Consistency Seeker, the Self-Esteem Maximizer, and the Terror Manager. For the Consistency Seeker, it is shown through cognitive dissonance, balance theory, and the norm of reciprocity underscored the intensity people reorganize beliefs and behaviors to preserve a non-contradictory self-concept.
For Self-Esteem Maximizer, the course-work we studied focused on self-presentation, stigma, and stereotyping which revealed the lengths to which individuals defend personal beliefs and values. Through mechanisms of self-handicapping, basking in self reflected flory, and in-group biases, it is shon that self-esteem is a master motive. 
For Terror Manager, we explored mortality salience and cultural world-view defenses, Terror-Management Theory explained that spikes in prejudice, specific worldviews, specific beliefs, and other self-destructive tendencies can be used to buffer against existential anxiety, showing that we are managers of terror. 

These three individual "images" work together to emphasize a complete picture of humankind. Together they provide a coherent meaning system, affective self-worth, and existential security as the motives behind our social cognition and behavior. 

#### Original Image-Set: 

At the semester's start, and on original submission, I characterized humans primarily as Cultural Animals, Group Members, and Information Seekers, which stressed the external influences of culture, collective belonging, and epistemic curiosity. 

#### Reflect: 

Early in the semester, the course work emphasized cultural influences on human nature. We studied the influences of language, norms, institutions, and how that influences human behavior, however the question remained "Why do people cling to culture, groups, and knowledge?". As we continued to studied social psychology, the Consistency, Esteem, and Terror Motives supplied a unifying answer which regulates psychological equilibrium. 

In recent topics we have studied stereotyping and prejudice; which has shown that mortality-salient individuals show harsher out-group judgments, illustrating Terror Management motives underneath group-level bias. We studied Persuasion and Attitude Change; which showed that the discomfort of holding counter-attitudinal positions (dissonance) activates the consistency-seeker. We studied self-presentation and esteem, which showed that impression-management tactics, self-affirmation interventions, and prejudice-reduction strategies revolve around protecting, restoring, and fostering self-esteem. 

In the old review, whereas cultural animal and group member describes contexts in which behavior occurs, the new images, specify mechanisms via the experiments discussed in class. 

Revisiting my initial stance illuminated a developmental arc in my understanding: from seeing humans as products of culture and collectives to appreciating the intrapsychic motives that make those structures indispensable. 
The Consistency Seeker, Self‑Esteem Maximizer, and Terror Manager together capture how people strive to preserve coherent, valued, and ultimately meaningful selves—motives that, when threatened, manifest in the very social phenomena we analysed all semester.
