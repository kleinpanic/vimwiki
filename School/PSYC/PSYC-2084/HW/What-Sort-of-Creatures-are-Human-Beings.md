## Goal 
The goals of this activity are to introduce you to one type of supplemental reading source and to encourage you to reflect on some classic and contemporary social psychological perspectives regarding who we are.

## Instructions

1. Read the paper entitled, ‘Social Psychologists and Thinking about People’ (attached). This reading outlines some ‘images’ of humankind that have been/are prominent in the field of social psychology.

2. Write about which combination of the images you think best characterizes us and why you think so. A brief paragraph (some thoughtful sentences) describing the reasons for each of your selections is expected.

Type your responses in a separate document. Save your document as a PDF before uploading it in the portal. You may submit your PDF anytime until SUNDAY (02/02) at 11:59 PM.

## Submission 

Social psychology presents us with several images of humanity, each emphasizing different aspects of our nature. After reading the paper, I believe a combination of The Cultural Animal, The Group Member, and the Information Seeker best characterizes humankind. 
The Cultural Animal
Humans are fundamentally shaped by culture, which provides the structure necessary for social cooperation, survival, and meaning. Unlike other species, humans use language, social norms, and institutions to shape their world. Culture influences everything from normality to identity, making it a defining factor in human nature. 
The Group Member
Humans are inherently social beings who derive identity and purpose from group membership. Whether through family, work, or society at large, individuals function within groups, sometimes leading to collective wisdom or, conversely, irrational group behavior. This aspect is crucial in explaining phenomena like social conformity, groupthink, mass hysteria, intergroup conflict, and in vs out group conflicts. 
The Information Seeker
People constantly seek knowledge about their environment, others, and themselves. This drive to acquire information underlies decision-making, learning, and adaptability. From a cognitive perspective, humans process vast amounts of data to navigate the world, making this a core phenomenon of their nature. 
By integrating all of these different perspectives and actives, we get a balanced view of human beings as cultural, social, and intellectually driven creatures.
