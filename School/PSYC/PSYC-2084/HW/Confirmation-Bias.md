## Goal 

The goal of this activity is to critique the benefits and detriments of our tendency toward confirmation bias.

## Insutrctions 

A. Review the Confirmation Bias lecture slides. You can find them within the The Core Elements of Social Cognition lecture slides on the course Canvas page.

B. View the video [‘Confirmation Bias and the Evolution of Reason’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-TXeQwla84)
C. Respond to the following questions. A brief paragraph (some thoughtful sentences) in response to each question is expected.

1. What is the major difference between the ‘Accurate’ perspective on the evolution of human reason and the ‘Argumentative’ perspective?

2. Describe the two roles humans take according to the Argumentative perspective and how each role contributes to behaviors that typically characterize confirmation bias?

3. Collective reasoning can often be less biased than reasoning alone. However, under certain conditions, collective reasoning is more biased than reasoning alone. What is one condition of a group that can increase the potential for biased decision-making? Why does this condition increase the potential for bias?

4. Integrating information from the lecture with information from the video, describe two (2) benefits of our tendency toward confirmation bias and two (2) detriments.

## Submissions

1. What is the major difference between the ‘Accurate’ perspective on the evolution of human reason and the ‘Argumentative’ perspective?


The “Accurate” perspective suggests that human reasoning evolved primarily to help us perceive and understand the world as objectively and precisely as possible. With this viewpoint, the main function of reasoning is to gather unbiased evidence and arrive at valid, almost arguably scientific conclusions. By the contrasts, the “Argumentative” perspective proposes that reason itself evolved as a social tool for persuasion. It acts to help individuals defend their own viewpoints and convince others to join theirs. In this social, argumentative framework, human beings are often less concerned with being “right” or objective and are more motivated to justify their own preexisting beliefs or decisions and persuade others to accept or entertain them. This difference underlies why people frequently exhibit confirmation bias, interpreting new information in ways to reinforce their prior conclusion or belief. 


2. Describe the two roles humans take according to the Argumentative perspective and how each role contributes to behaviors that typically characterize confirmation bias?
According to the Argumentative perspective, humans typically move between two roles. Firstly the “producer” or creator of arguments and secondly the “evaluator” of other’s arguments. When acting as the producers people focus on assembling evidence or reasons or logic in favor of their position, often in a selective manner that may not align with objectivity, but a manner that highlights supporting facts and dismisses counterevidence - reinforcing their own biases or beliefs. When acting as evaluators, people criticize, scrutinize, and all around discuss other’s arguments - though often looking primarily for flaws that reinforce their own preconceived notions. Both roles contribute to the formation of the confirmation bias. As producers we create or look for selective data that supports our own beliefs; as Evaluators, we criticize and scrutinize other opposing views while accepting evidence that aligns with preexisting beliefs. This dynamic encourages confirmation biases. It increases our aptitude to hold onto familiar schemas or prior beliefs rather than revise our own beliefs in light of contradictory evidence. 


3. Collective reasoning can often be less biased than reasoning alone. However, under certain conditions, collective reasoning is more biased than reasoning alone. What is one condition of a group that can increase the potential for biased decision-making? Why does this condition increase the potential for bias?


This is arguably known as an echo chamber. A condition that tends to create one, and exacerbate biases is known as group homogeneity. This is when group members share very similar beliefs, lifestyles, backgrounds, values, or perspectives. Such homogeneity causes a phenomenon known as groupthink in which the group collectively ignores contradictory evidence while reinforcing their own beliefs further. Because members are so similar, or due to group pressures to be part of the in group, critical thinking, and descent is muted. The drive for a consensus in opinion can overshadow the quest for accuracy. In this scenario, confirmation bias arises as the group readily endorses information that support their shared idea and are less probable to consider challenging viewpoints causing an echochamber - a repetition of the same idea over and over again. 


4. Integrating information from the lecture with information from the video, describe two (2) benefits of our tendency toward confirmation bias and two (2) detriments.


Benefits 
One benefit is group homogeneity. By quickly filtering out contradictory information, a sense of certainty, or a sense of truth having been reached can be achieved faster. This helps decisive actions when time is limited. 
Another benefit is the social aspects of it. Confirmation bias can promote harmony within a group by causing group think, and promoting a feeling of being in the “In group”. If everyone selectively interprets evidence to align with the group’s belief, more social cohesion is achieved, though diversity of thought is much less.   


Detriments 
A large detriment is the suppression of ideas, and further the resistance to useful new information. Contradictory facts are often discounted, confirmation biases can cause one to ignore or even remain unaware of valuable information backed by objective evidence. This can lead to ill informed decision making. 
Another large detriment is the polarization of confirmation biases. When people consistently confirm their own viewpoints they become more entrenched and overconfident with that same ideal. This heightens conflict between individuals or groups with opposing views often causing constructive discourse to be discouraged or all together unfeasible. A great example of this actually is the 2 party system in the US! Yay for America!
