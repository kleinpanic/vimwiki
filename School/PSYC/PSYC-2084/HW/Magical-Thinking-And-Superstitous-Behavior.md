After you have finished the reading, take some time to consider the arguments, the research findings, and your own thoughts about them…then answer the question below. A brief paragraph (some thoughtful sentences) in response is expected.

Recall a situation in which you (or a friend or family member) engaged in magical thinking and/or superstitious behavior. Describe the situation and how you (they) responded. Use the factors described in the paper to analyze the situation and how you (they) responded (i.e., Which factors manifested themselves in the situation and how?

### Answer / Submission : 

According to the research conducted by Damisch et al. (2010) in "Keep your Fingers Crossed! How Superstitution Improves Performance," engaging in superstitous behavior can enhance performance due to increased self-efficiacy and persistence. Throughout my life, I have witnessed and personally engaed in various instances of superstitious bheavior. One such example occurs whenever I take an exam on paper. I will use the mechanical pencil my mother gave me when I first went into college. I know it really doesn't affect my grade, I live my life pretty statically and governed by logic, however I do it because there is a part of me that believes it helps as the first time I did it I got an A on that exam. My personal experience aligns with their findings that by engaging in this ritual, I felt more confident in my ability to perform well, reducing anxiety and reinforcing a positive mindset. The article lso suggests that individuals experieincing stress or uncertainty are more likely to engage in supersittious behavior. Given the high-stake natures of exams, the reliance or practice of this ritual may be a way to create a sense of control in a scenarior of high stress.
