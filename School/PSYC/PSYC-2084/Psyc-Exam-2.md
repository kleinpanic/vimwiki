# Psyc exam 2: 

## General Info:

- Exam 2 is Tuesday (4/15) at usual meeting time and usual classroom. Exam will be paper/pencil, worth 80 points, and contains material from the following topics:
    - Topic 5 (Nature, Origins, and Functions of the Self: **Only first part: How do we come to know the self**)
    - Topic 6 (Key Self-motives)
    - Topic 7 (Social Influence)
    - Topic 8 (Persuasion, Attitudes, and Behavior: **ONLY up to slide 10**)
- 39 multiple choice and true/false questions. 
  
## Topic 5 - Nature, Origins, and Functions of the Self: 

### 1. What is the self? 

- Self concept is a person's knowledge about themselves. This is to include: 
  - Traits, Social identities, Past Expeirences, ontological identities.
- The self concept has: 
  - Core Beliefs / traits that don't change easily (Stable features)
  - Traits tht emerge based on the situation / context (Malleable Features)
- Working Self-concept:
    - THe working self-concept is the part of your self concept that is currently activated and strongly influencing your thoughts, behaviors, and actions. For instance when around paritnes, "Obedient child" self might emerge. 

- External Influences on the Self: 
  - Culture and Socialization shape:
      - Identities (Nationality, gender, etc)
      - Roles (Friend, daughter, employee)
      - Traits (Caring, Competitive, shy)
- Independent vs Interdependent Self: 
  - Independent Self: 
    - Emphasized in western cultures.
    - Focus on personal goals, uniqueness
  - Interdependent Self:
    - Emphasized in Eastern Cultures
    - Focs on relationships, harmony, fitting in. 

- Social Identity Theory: 
  - People define themselves by the social groups they belong to (race, religion, political partym sports team, etc).
  - Strong in group is a strong self - esteem.

### 2. How Do We Come to Know Ourselves? 

#### 3 Mechanisms: 

| Mechanism                               | Explanation                                             | Example                                    |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Reflect Appraisals (Looking-glass self) | We learn who we are based on how we think others see us | You infer you're funny bc people laught    |
| Social Comparison                       | We compare ourselves to others to evaluate traits       | Comparing Test grades with classmates      |
| Self-Perception                         | We infer our traits by observing our behavior           | "If i go to the gym, I care about fitness" |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|

#### Social Comparison Theory (Festinger): 
* Upward Comparison: Compare to people better than us -> can inspire or demoralize.
* Downward Comparison: Compare to people worst off -> boosts self-esteem.

#### Error: The "Better Than Average Effect"
- The statistically impossible idea that most people believe they're above average. 
-> Common in traits like:
    * Driving ability.
    * Intelligence
    * Attractiveness

### 3. Self-perception Theory (Bem): 
When internal cues are weak or ambigious -> we infer who we are from our behavior. 
-> Facial Feedback Hypothesis = Smiling can actually cause happiness. 

### 4. Self-Regulation - How We Control Ourselves

Self-Regulation is controlling thoughts, feelings, behaviors to meet goals.
It requires self awareness, goal setting, mental time travel. 

#### Self-Awareness Theory:
* Being self-aware makes us evaluate ourselves. We compare "Who I am now" to "Who I want to be"

If there's a gap:
* If achievable -> motivation to improve.
* If unachievable -> Escape Behaviors (Denial, distractions, addictions).

#### Self-Discrepancy Theory (Higgins):

| Self-Type  | Result if Gap Exists    |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Ideal Self | Sadness. Disappointment |
| Ought Self | Anxiety, Guilt          |
|------------|-------------------------|

#### Escaping Self-Awareness:

Occurs if: 
* Gap is too big.
* Can't close the gap
* Leads to: Additions, reclusiveness, zoning out, 
  
### 5. Goal Setting - How Goals Work 

#### Goal Activation: 
* Can be conscious or automatic (environmental cues)

#### Construal Level Theory: 

| Time Perspective | Focus            |
|------------------|------------------|
| Near Future      | Concrete Details |
| Far Future       | Abstract Meaning |
|------------------|------------------|

-> Example:
* Near future gym goal: "Pack gym bag"
* Far future gym goal: "Be healthier"

#### Affective Forecasting: 
- Predicting how future events will make us feel -> people often get this wrong.
    - Overestimate impact of good/bad events.
    - Winning lottery? Less long-term happiness than expected.
    - Break-up? Less permanent sadness than expected. 

### 6. Self-Regulator Challenges

#### Delay of Gratification: 
* Resisting short-term temptationg for long-term gain.

#### Hot vs Cold Processes: 

| Hot Process          | Cold Process      |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Emotional, Impulsive | Rational, Mindful |
|----------------------|-------------------|

Example:
Marshmellow test with kids -> those with delayed gratification had greater success in life decades later.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|

## Topic 6 - Key Self Motives: Consistency, Esteem, and Presentation

### 1. Maintaining a Consistent Self: 

#### A) Cognitive Dissonance Theory

Definition: Cognitive Dissonance is a psychological tension that arises when there's an inconsistency between two or more beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors. 

Why it matters: Inconsistencies create a mental discomfort that can lead people to shift or justify their attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors to restore consistency. 

##### Three Primary Ways to Reduce Dissonance:
1. Change one of the cognitions: E.g if you believe smoking is unhealthy, yet you smoke, you might change your thinking to smoking helps me relax
2. Add a third cognition: e.g I smoke, but I also eat healthy and excercise.
3. Trivialize the inconsistency: e.g I smoke, but its no big deal, many people do it. 
   
##### Classic Study – Induced Compliance Paradigm:

* Participants do a boring task, then are asked to lie to the next participant, saying “it was fun.”

* Those paid $1 vs. $20 → The $1 group had insufficient justification for lying, thus they convinced themselves the task wasn’t that bad (changed their attitude to reduce dissonance).

##### Key Factors Affecting Dissonance:

* Weak external justification: The less the external reward or pressure, the more tension people feel for an inconsistent act.

* Perceived choice: People experience more dissonance if they feel they freely chose the behavior.

* Commitment: If you’re more committed to the behavior or attitude, you’ll feel greater pressure to reconcile inconsistencies.

* Foreseeable negative consequences: If your actions create harm you could have predicted, dissonance intensifies.

* Cultural influences: Collectivist cultures might experience dissonance more in group contexts, whereas individualist cultures might feel it more in personal contexts.

#### B) Applications of Dissonance Theory

1. Induced Hypocricy Paradigm: 
   * People who publically advocate a position they already believe in, then are reminded of times they acted contrary, feel dissonance.
   * Example is telling people using seatbelts then not. They often correct their behavior.
2. Effort Justification:
   * If you choose an action with negative or unpleasant conseuqneces, you will feel dissonance about the sufferigng you endured.
   * To reduce this, people convince themselves it was worth it.
   * Examples: severe initiations into frats / srats. It was tuff so these relationships must be valuable.
3. Self-Narratives over time:
   * People want to see themselves as consistent across time. They craft self-narratives that form a coherent story of their life.
   * Contamination stores: Life was going well, something ruined it.
   * Redemption stories: HArd times lead to growth
   * Nostalgic: help maintain self contuinity, elevate modd, reduce dissonance. 
     
### 2. The Self-Esteem Motive.

#### a) Defining Self-Esteem
Self Esteem is the level of positive feelings you have about yourself as a whole. 
**Sources:** 
1. Genetics: Some inherited personality traits (e.g. extraversion, resilienc) can correlate with higher self-esteem.
2. Social Comparisons, reflected appraisals: if your environemnt provides lots of priase, or you compare favorable to peers, self esteem tends to be higher.
3. Cultural Standards: Some cultures prioritize academic achievement, other emphasize social harmony. Meeting these local standards lifts self-esteem. 
   
#### b) Terror Management Theory (TMT)
**Core Idea:**
* Humans are uniquely aware of our mortality. THis knowledge produces existential terror.
* We manage terror by clinging to cultural worldviews and beliefs that create meaning and order (Relgion, national identity, traditions).

**Cultural Worldviews:**
* Provide a "Theory of Reality" ensuring that life has purpose and that "Worthy" individuals will be protected (Symbolically or literally) from death.
* Institutions, symbols, and rituations reinforce the worldview.

**Self-Esteem's Role**
* Serves as an "Anxiety Buffer" -> Tells us we're living up to our cultral values.
* People strive for self-esteem to quell the fear of death.
* Literal Immortality: Belief in an Afterlife.
* Symbolic Immortality: Achievements, Legacies, Children, Cultural Contributions. 
  
**Worldview Defense**
* When people are reminded of mortality, they become more defensive of their cultural worldview -> e.g more positive to in-group, more negative toward out-group

#### c) Maintaing & Defending Self-Esteem
People use multiple psychological strategies to protect or bolster their self-esteem. 

1. Self-Serving Attributions
* Internal attributions for successes (“I worked hard”)
* External attributions for failures (“The teacher was unfair”).

2. Self-Handicapping

* Creating obstacles so if you fail, you can blame the obstacle, not your ability.
* e.g., Partying the night before an exam → “I failed because I was hungover, not because I’m stupid.”

3. Better-Than-Average Effect

* We often see ourselves as above average in skills, intelligence, etc.

4. Projection

* Seeing in others the traits we fear we ourselves possess → deflecting negativity onto them.

5. Symbolic Self-Completion

* After a threat to a valued identity (e.g., doubting your competence as a musician), you display symbols or achievements reinforcing that identity (e.g., buying an expensive guitar).

6. Compensation

* Making up for a failure in one domain by focusing on success in another.
* e.g., If you fail a big math test, you might double down on your excellence in sports.

7. Self-Affirmation Theory

* Affirming a valued aspect of yourself (e.g., “I’m a caring friend”) can reduce the sting of a threat (e.g., receiving critical feedback about your writing).

8. Social Comparison & Identification

* Downward comparison → Compare with worse-off others to feel better.
* Basking in Reflected Glory (BIRG) → We affiliate with successful others (“my team won!”) to absorb some of that success.
* Cutting Off Reflected Failure (CORF) → Distancing from others who fail or have low status.

9. Ostracism

* Being left out or excluded can hurt self-esteem severely.
* Cyberball experiments show that just being cut out of a virtual game can evoke strong feelings of rejection.

#### d) The good, the bad, and the ugly of self-esteem. 

* Self-esteem cannot simply be given; it tends to come from perceived competence, achievement, or acceptance.
* Unstable or artificially inflated self-esteem can cause problems like narcissism or aggression when threatened.
* Striving for self-esteem can have constructive consequences (e.g., motivation, resilience) or destructive ones (e.g., prejudice, risky behaviors to “prove” oneself).
**Self-Compassion**:
* An alternative route → Being kind to yourself in failure, acknowledging flaws without harsh judgment, can lead to stable, healthy self-esteem.

### 3. Self-Presentation

#### a) Dramaturgical Perspective
Erving Goffman's idea that social life is akin to a theatrical performance.

* We put on different "Masks" or "roles" depending on the social script or audience.
* When everyone knows the script and performs well, social interactions are smooth and meaningful. 
  
**Sincere vs. Cynical Performances:**
* Sincere = you turly believe in the role you're playing.
* Cynical = you perform soleyl to impress or manipulate the autdience, without internal commitment to that role. 
  
#### b) Self-Presentational Strategies
1. Honing an Image
* Self-Promotion: Presenting strengths or achievements to appear competent.
* Supplication: Presenting oneself as needy or helpless to receive help or sympathy.
* Ingratiation: Flattering others, being overly kind, or agreeing to gain approval.

2. Audience Segregation
* Using different communication channels or personas for different groups.
* e.g., Maintaining separate social media accounts or adjusting style when talking to coworkers vs. close friends.

3. Maintaining Face and Lying
* “Face” = Positive social value a person claims for themselves. We often preserve others’ face, too, by not calling out every error.
* Sometimes we lie or exaggerate to keep up appearances (though we risk being caught in the lie).

#### c) Individual Differences in Self-Presentation
**Self-Monitoring:**
* High self-monitors → Highly attuned to social cues, adjust behavior to match. Skilled at “reading the room.”
* Low self-monitors → More consistent, less concerned with fitting each situation precisely.

#### d) Audience-Monitoring Errors
1. Spotlight Effect: We overestimate how much others notice or pay attention to us.
    * e.g., If you spill coffee on your shirt, you think everyone sees it, but most people don’t.

2. Illusion of Transparency: We overestimate how obvious our internal emotions are to others.
    * e.g., Feeling extremely nervous giving a speech but thinking the audience can “see right through us,” when they probably don’t notice.

#### e) Fundamental Motivations for Self-Presentation
1. Achieve Goals → e.g., Dress nicely for a job interview.
2. Convey & Protect Self-Image → If we want to be seen as creative, we highlight creative projects.
3. Enact Cultural Scripts & Roles → Ensures smooth social interactions.
4. Self-Improvement & Growth → Sometimes adopting a persona can motivate us to become that persona.

## Topic 7 - Social Influences 

### 1  Big‑Picture Road‑Map
| **Section** | **Key Questions** |
|-------------|------------------|
| 1. Foundations | What *is* social influence? How do norms shape behavior? |
| 2. Conformity | Why do people match the majority? Which variables amplify or dampen it? |
| 3. Compliance | How do request‑makers get a “yes”? What psychological levers do they pull? |
| 4. Obedience | Why do people follow direct orders—even harmful ones? |
| 5. Integrating Themes | Similarities & differences among the three, cultural moderators, resisting influence |
| 6. Exam & Application Tips | What to watch for on test day and in real life |

### 2  Foundations: Norms & Social Learning
#### 2.1 What is Social Influence?
> *The effects of other people on an individual’s beliefs, attitudes, values, or behavior.*

* **Social learning** – we internalize culture by *observing* others (parents, peers, media).  
* **Norms** – mental rules about “what people do” (*descriptive*) and “what people approve/disapprove” (*injunctive*)  
  * Descriptive norm example: “Most students check their phone within 5 min of waking.”  
  * Injunctive norm example: “Cheating is wrong.”

### 3  Conformity

#### 3.1 Definition & Two Core Mechanisms
| **Type**                  | **Core Need Satisfied**                      | **Classic Demo**                                                          |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Informational influence* | Need to be **correct**; others = reality cue | Sherif’s autokinetic illusion (moving‑light) study                        |
| *Normative influence*     | Need to be **liked/accepted**                | Asch’s line‑judgment study (public compliance without private acceptance) |

#### 3.2 Asch Paradigm—Key Numbers
* 75 % conformed at least once.  
* Conformity jumped when group size rose from 1 → 3 confederates, then plateaued.  

#### 3.3 Variables That Shift Conformity
| **Increases Conformity**                    | **Decreases Conformity**                         |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Larger unanimous majority (up to ≈ 4)       | Presence of a single ally (breaks unanimity)     |
| Higher group cohesion / in‑group status     | Anonymous or private responses                   |
| Ambiguous or difficult task (informational) | High self‑confidence / expertise                 |
| Collectivist culture values harmony         | Emphasis on individuality (priming independence) |

#### 3.4 Minority Influence (Supplement)  
*Moscovici* showed that a **consistent**, **confident** minority can shift majorities (e.g., “blue‑green” slides). Mechanism: makes majority *re‑examine* issue (often private, delayed conversion).

### 4  Compliance – *“The Art & Science of Getting What You Want”*

#### 4.1 Definition  
> A change in behavior elicited by a **direct request** (not an order) from another person.

#### 4.2 Six Classic Principles & Tactics (Cialdini + lecture)

| **Principle**                | **Representative Tactics**                                                                     | **Why It Works**                                           |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consistency / Commitment** | *Foot‑in‑the‑Door* (small → big request); *Low‑balling* (agree → reveal hidden cost) | People strive to appear consistent with prior commitments. |
| **Reciprocity**              | *Door‑in‑the‑Face* (large → moderate request); free samples                          | Social norm to repay favors/ concessions.                  |
| **Social Proof**             | “Most of your neighbors recycle”                                                               | We look to others when uncertain; conformity heuristic.    |
| **Liking**                   | Compliments, similarity, attractive salesperson                                                | We say yes to people we like.                              |
| **Authority**                | Uniforms, titles, expert endorsements                                                          | Obedience shortcut (“experts must know”).                  |
| **Scarcity**                 | Limited‑time offer, “only 2 seats left”                                                        | Items/events seem more valuable when less available.       |

*Mood effects*: Good mood ↑ compliance (heuristic “If I feel good, it must be a good idea”). Mild guilt can also ↑ helping to relieve discomfort.

### 5  Obedience to Authority

#### 5.1 Definition  
> Performing an action to **fulfill a direct order** from an authority figure.

#### 5.2 Milgram’s Shock Experiments (1961–63)
* 65 % of participants delivered the maximum 450 V label (“XXX—Danger”).  
* None refused before 315 V (learner’s first scream & silence).  
* Ethical concerns later spurred tighter IRB rules; partial replications (Burger 2009) still show high obedience (~70 % to 150 V).

#### 5.3 Key Variables (slide & subsequent research)
| **Variable**                                     | **Effect on Obedience**                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Proximity of Authority** (same room vs. phone) | Closer authority ↑ obedience.                                           |
| **Proximity of Victim**                          | Closer victim ↓ obedience (touch‑proximity variant ≈ 30 %).             |
| **Witnessing Peer Defiance**                     | Presence of dissenters ↓ obedience to ≤ 10 %.                           |
| **Institutional Legitimacy**                     | Prestige (Yale vs. warehouse) matters but effect modest (61 % vs 48 %). |

#### 5.4 Why Do We Obey?
1. **Socialization & Early Learning** – taught to respect teachers, police, doctors.  
2. **Agentic State** – people see themselves as an “agent” executing another’s wishes → reduced personal responsibility.  
3. **Gradual Escalation / Entrapment** – foot‑in‑the‑door of shocks (15 V increments).  
4. **Evolutionary Perspective** – coordinated groups need hierarchical control for survival.


### 6  Integrating the Three Forms

|                     | **Conformity**             | **Compliance**                   | **Obedience**                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Request Type**    | *Implicit* social pressure | *Explicit* request               | *Command*                     |
| **Power Source**    | Majority norms             | Reciprocity, commitment, etc.    | Authority’s legitimacy        |
| **Typical Outcome** | Public or private change   | Usually public behavior          | Often against personal values |
| **Classic Study**   | Asch lines                 | Foot‑in‑door (Freedman & Fraser) | Milgram shocks                |

#### Cultural & Personality Moderators
* **Collectivism** → ↑ normative conformity; obedience similar cross‑culturally.  
* **Authoritarianism, need for approval** → ↑ obedience & conformity.  
* **Self‑esteem, reactance** → ↓ compliance when freedom feels threatened.

#### Resisting Unwanted Influence
1. **Awareness of norms/tactics** (e.g., noticing scarcity ploy).  
2. **Allies** – even one dissenter dramatically lowers conformity/obedience.  
3. **Practice “attitude inoculation”** – rehearse counter‑arguments to build defenses.  
4. **Reassert personal agency** – “I am responsible for my choices.”

| Predict obedience level under altered Milgram condition | *Application*: Victim in same room? Authority on phone?                                   |
| Explain how descriptive norms backfire                  | Energy‑use study: “Below‑average users *increase* consumption unless given approval cue.” |

**Everyday Applications**  
* Marketing uses *scarcity* (“flash sales”), *social proof* (star ratings).  
* Public‑health messages succeed when they align *injunctive* and *descriptive* norms (e.g., “Most students already drink moderately, and it’s the healthy choice”).  
* Corporate scandals (e.g., unethical orders) mirror Milgram dynamics—employees obey hierarchical pressure.

## 8  Key Takeaways
1. **Norms are powerful**; even subtle cues shift perceptions of “appropriate” behavior.  
2. **Conformity, compliance, and obedience are distinct but overlapping** routes by which others steer us.  
3. **Situational forces usually outweigh personality**—a central lesson of Milgram and Asch.  
4. **Knowledge = resistance**: Understanding influence tactics is the first defense against manipulation.

## Topic 8 - Persuasion, Attitudes, and Behavior

### 1 Orientation & Core Definitions
| **Term**       | **Precise Meaning**                                                                                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attitude**   | A global evaluation of a stimulus (object, issue, person, behavior) that can range from very negative → very positive |
| **Persuasion** | Any *intentional* effort to change another person’s attitudes so their **behavior** will change as well               |

Why the fuss? Attitudes influence **attention**, **memory**, **judgment**, and ultimately **action** (voting, buying, helping). Being able to *shift* attitudes is therefore a cornerstone of social psychology, advertising, health promotion, and political campaigning.

### 2 Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)

|                     | **Central Route**                                                 | **Peripheral Route**                                                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | Persuasion via *systematic, effortful* scrutiny of arguments      | Persuasion via *heuristic* cues (speaker’s looks, music, number of arguments) |
| **Requirements**    | **Motivation** *and* **ability** to think carefully               | Either motivation *or* ability is low                                         |
| **Outcome Quality** | Attitudes are stronger, more durable, more predictive of behavior | Attitudes are weaker, more malleable                                          |

#### 2.1 Determinants of Route
* **Motivation** → personal relevance, accountability, need for cognition.  
* **Ability** → time, cognitive load, knowledge, message clarity 

> **Exam cue**: If a vignette says the audience is *distracted* or “only half‑listening,” expect the *peripheral* route to dominate.

#### 2.2 Why Route Matters
Central‑route attitudes resist counter‑persuasion, persist over time, and guide behavior (e.g., recycling even when no one’s watching). Peripheral‑route attitudes fade or flip when the cue disappears.


### 3 Persuasion Triad: **Source × Message × Audience**

#### 3.1 Source (Who?)
| **Dimension**                   | **Details & Effects**                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Credibility**                 | Expertise + trustworthiness. True experts persuade via central route; *appearance* of expertise (lab coat, titles) works peripherally |
| **Sleeper Effect**              | Over time, people remember a message but forget its discredited source, so low‑credibility messages can rebound in influence          |
| **Attractiveness & Similarity** | Operate mainly through peripheral route; we prefer in‑group, familiar, or good‑looking communicators.                                 |

> *Real‑world note*: Influencer marketing leverages **similarity** (“people like me”) more than formal expertise.

### 3.2 Message (What?)
1. **Argument Strength & Clarity** – matters chiefly for central processing.  
2. **Length** – long messages persuade *only* if filled with strong points; otherwise dilution occurs.  
3. **Statistics vs. Vivid Instances** – vivid anecdotes can trump dry data because they evoke emotion & imagery.  
5. **Emotion**  
   * **Positive Mood** → “Feel‑good heuristic”; people agree more readily when happy.  
   * **Fear Appeals** → Most effective when:  
     - Danger is serious & likely.  
     - Clear, feasible steps to avert threat are provided.  
   * **Mere Exposure** → Repetition breeds familiarity, which breeds liking (up to a saturation point).  
6. **Metacognition** – People’s *confidence* in their own thoughts (“I feel sure these arguments are strong”) can magnify persuasion.

### 3.3 Audience (To Whom?)
| **Characteristic**           | **Implication**                                                                                     |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Age (18–25)**              | Most attitude malleability                                                                          |
| **Self‑Esteem**              | Lower self‑esteem → greater persuadability (peripheral cues); high self‑esteem → may counter‑argue. |
| **Education / Intelligence** | Higher education = better counter‑arguing; need stronger arguments.                                 |
| **Need for Cognition**       | High NFC → central route; low NFC → peripheral route.                                               |
| **Self‑Monitoring**          | High self‑monitors buy image; swayed by ads promising social approval.                              |

**Initial Attitude**  
* *One‑sided* messages work when audience already agrees.  
* *Two‑sided* messages (acknowledge counter‑arguments) are better for skeptical audiences; they signal fairness.

## 4 Resistance to Persuasion

1. **Forewarning** – Knowing a persuasion attempt is coming raises defenses; people generate counter‑arguments  
2. **Psychological Reactance** – When freedom feels threatened, people do the opposite (e.g., “Don’t tell me what to listen to!”).  
3. **Attitude Inoculation** – Like a vaccine: exposure to weak attacks plus practice refuting them builds resistance to stronger attacks later.  
4. **Knowledge of Tactics** – Recognizing a scarcity ploy or emotional manipulation dampens its power.

> **Study Tip**: Be ready to match *specific* resistance mechanism to scenario (“teens smoke more when ads are banned” = reactance).

## 5 Integration with Other Topics

| **Link**                                | **Explanation**                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cognitive Dissonance** (Topic 6)      | Persuasion sometimes triggers dissonance → self‑persuasion.                                            |
| **Conformity & Social Proof** (Topic 7) | Descriptive‑norm messages (“90 % of hotel guests reuse towels”) harness both persuasion & conformity.  |
| **Self‑Regulation** (Topic 5)           | Central‑route persuasion changes personal standards, affecting long‑term self‑regulation (e.g., diet). |

## 6 Contemporary Applications & Pitfalls

* **Digital Micro‑Targeting** – Algorithms match message *frame* to personality traits (e.g., introverts get different political ads than extroverts).  
* **Misinformation Spread** – Repetition + vivid stories exploit peripheral processing; combating requires *inoculation* and *fact‑checking prompts*.  
* **Health Campaigns** – Fear appeals about vaping succeed only if paired with actionable quitting resources.  
* **Environmental Behavior** – Combining injunctive (“protect the planet”) and descriptive (“most neighbors recycle”) norms maximizes impact.

## 7 Key Take‑Home Principles

1. **Dual‑Process**: Persuasion isn’t one‑size‑fits‑all—motivation & ability steer the route.  
2. **Cue‑Congruence**: Source, message, and audience factors *interact*; a credible but *dull* message may fail with low‑NFC audiences.  
3. **Durability vs. Expediency**: Central‑route change is harder to achieve but pays off in lasting behavior; peripheral change is quick but fragile.  
4. **Defense is Possible**: Forewarning, inoculation, and critical thinking are effective shields.

### Lightning‑Round Mnemonic
**“C‑M‑A‑R”**  
*Credibility* → *Message strength* → *Audience match* → *Route chosen*.

Remember this flow and you can analyze any persuasion scenario on the fly.

> *Big Idea*: **The self (Topics 5‑6) both shapes and is shaped by social influence (Topic 7) and persuasion (Topic 8).** For example, need for *consistency* makes us vulnerable to *foot‑in‑the‑door* tactics, while *self‑presentation* concerns fuel *normative conformity*.

### 2 Key Theories & Their “Signature” Findings

| **Theory / Model**                  | **One‑Sentence Essence**                                             | **Classic Evidence**                                 | **Likely Exam Angle**                                                            |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Working Self‑Concept**            | Only a slice of self‑knowledge is active at any moment.              | People describe different traits at home vs. work.   | Scenario: “Why did Alex emphasize ‘leader’ at work but ‘musician’ with friends?” |
| **Social Comparison**               | We evaluate ourselves by benchmarking against similar others.        | Upward vs. downward mood effects.                    | Predict outcome of comparing GPA with valedictorian.                             |
| **Cognitive Dissonance**            | Inconsistency → tension → attitude/behavior change.                  | \$1 vs. \$20 boring‑task study.                      | Identify which of three strategies reduces dissonance.                           |
| **Terror Management Theory**        | Self‑esteem & worldviews buffer death anxiety.                       | Mortality‑salience boosts in‑group bias.             | Explain prejudice spike after mortality reminder.                                |
| **Dramaturgical Self‑Presentation** | Social life = stage; we manage impressions via scripts.              | High vs. low self‑monitors adapting behavior.        | Distinguish sincere vs. cynical performance.                                     |
| **Asch Conformity**                 | Unanimous majority sways judgments even when obviously wrong.        | 75 % conformed at least once.                        | How does adding an ally affect results?                                          |
| **Compliance Principles**           | Reciprocity, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, scarcity. | Door‑in‑the‑face donation jump.                      | Spot tactic in marketing vignette.                                               |
| **Milgram Obedience**               | Ordinary people obey authority to harmful extremes.                  | 65 % to 450 V.                                       | Predict obedience change if victim is closer.                                    |
| **ELM (Persuasion Routes)**         | Motivation + ability ⇒ central route; otherwise peripheral.          | Strong vs. weak arguments matter only when involved. | Decide route when audience is distracted but ad uses celeb.                      |

### 3 Comparative Snapshot

|                         | **Self‑Regulation**                 | **Self‑Motives**                      | **Social Influence**       | **Persuasion**                    |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Primary Need**        | Goal attainment                     | Consistency · Esteem · Image          | Fitting in / obeying       | Attitude change                   |

### 4 Integrated Applied Examples

1. **Charity Tele‑Fundraiser**
   * Opens with “Most of your neighbors have already donated” → *descriptive norm* (conformity) + *social proof* (compliance).  
   * Offers free sticker → *reciprocity*.  
   * If you agree to “Just answer a short survey,” they later ask for money → *foot‑in‑the‑door*; refusal would create dissonance with your self‑image as helpful.

2. **Fitness‑App Notifications**
   * Shows streaks → leverages *self‑regulation* (tracking goals).  
   * Sends public leader‑board → *upward comparison* for motivation.  
   * “Limited‑time discount on premium” → *scarcity* cue.

3. **Political Debate**
   * Candidate A uses detailed policy (central route) for high‑involvement viewers.  
   * Candidate B uses humor, patriotic music (peripheral route) for low‑NFC viewers.  
   * Post‑debate spin room tries to establish *injunctive norm* (“Everyone agrees B won!”) to foster conformity.

### 5 Master Mnemonics

* **“ACORN”** for dissonance reduction: **A**dd cognition, **C**hange cognition, **O**utweigh (trivialize), **R**einterpret, **N**ew behavior.  
* **“R‑C‑S‑L‑A‑S”** for compliance: **R**eciprocity, **C**onsistency, **S**ocial proof, **L**iking, **A**uthority, **S**carcity.  
* **“MAP”** for ELM route: **M**otivation + **A**bility ⇒ **P**ath (central). Lack either ⇒ peripheral.

### 6 Study & Exam Strategy

1. **Scenario Practice**  
   * Write mini‑vignettes and label every influence mechanism at play.  
   * Swap cause & effect: “What if the ally in Asch arrives *after* 3 trials?”

2. **Cross‑Topic Questions**  
   * “How might self‑esteem defenses interfere with attitude inoculation?”  
   * “Describe a persuasion tactic that exploits both normative conformity and peripheral cues.”

3. **Graph the Relationships**  
   * Map “level of self‑awareness” on X‑axis vs. “likelihood of escaping awareness” on Y‑axis; annotate with substance abuse example.

4. **Teach It**  
   * Explain cognitive dissonance to a non‑psych major in 60 seconds—forces clarity.

### 7 Rapid‑Fire Review Sheet

| **Term**                    | **Core Idea**                      | **1‑Word Trigger**  |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Working self‑concept        | Situation‑specific identity slice  | *Activated*         |
| Self‑discrepancy            | Gap → emotions (sad vs. anxious)   | *Ought/Ideal*       |
| Effort justification        | Painful choice → value inflated    | *Initiation*        |
| Mortality salience          | Death reminder → worldview defense | *TMT*               |
| Self‑handicapping           | Create excuse for failure          | *Obstacle*          |
| Informational vs. Normative | Accuracy vs. Approval              | *Why conform?*      |
| Low‑balling                 | Agree first, costs later           | *Car‑dealer*        |
| Agentic state               | “Just following orders”            | *Milgram*           |
| Sleeper effect              | Message lingers, source fades      | *Credibility‑decay* |
| Attitude inoculation        | Weak attack → resistance           | *Vaccine*           |

### 8 Bottom‑Line Takeaways

1. **The Self is Dynamic**: It is *constructed* through reflection, comparison, and culture, and it *regulates* behavior toward goals. 
2. **We Crave Consistency & Esteem**: These motives drive powerful cognitive gymnastics (dissonance reduction, esteem defenses) that make us both *resilient* and *predictably persuadable*. 
3. **Situations Trump Traits**: Group norms, request tactics, and authority pressure routinely override personal dispositions. 
4. **Persuasion is Dual‑Process**: Strong arguments win only when people are willing and able to think; otherwise, simple cues carry the day.
5. **Knowledge is Armor**: Recognizing these mechanisms—plus practicing counter‑arguing and seeking allies—shields you from unwanted influence.
