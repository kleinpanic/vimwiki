## Instructions: 

- Read the paper. After reading take tme to consider the arguments, research findings, and own thoughts about them then respond to prompts. 


## Prompts: 
Write a social media post (in whatever format you prefer; you are encouraged to be creative!) summarizing the central results reported in de Vries and colleagues (2018). Summarize the results IN YOUR OWN WORDS (i.e., limit jargon). You are NOT required to post your response on social media. Simply write your summary of the results AS IF you were planning to post it.
Given the results of this research, what changes to peopleâ€™s social media habits would you recommend in order to increase beneficial outcomes and decrease detrimental outcomes? A brief paragraph (some thoughtful sentences) in response is expected.

# 1. Social Media Post. 

Greetings Yall! I just read a fascinating study about how scrolling through stanges' insta posts can affect mood. The large takeaway from all of this? 
It really depends on whether we tend to compare ourselves a lot to others.
If you're someone who regularly compares youselfs to others, seeing people's super-happy, glamorous insta post might leave ya feeling worse about your own life and bring down your mood. 
If you don't compare yourself much, those same posts can boost your moode, almost like inspiration.
So it's not that instagram is itself good or bad for us, but rather its how we use the tool and how we process what we see. 

# 2. Recommended Changes. 

Given these findings, a practial step is to pay attention to how you feel after using the social media platform. If you notice often playing the "compare and despair" game consider adjusting your usage, and your following. On the opposite side of the spectrum, if you feel inspired by others, ensure that the habbit of using the social media platform does not become an addiction. Using it as a tool for positive inspiration is good, but often its dopamergic affects cause addiction in the userbase.
