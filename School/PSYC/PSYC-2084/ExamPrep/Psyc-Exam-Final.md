### Overview:
| Module                                        | What the concept **is**                                                                                                                                                                        | Why it matters                                                                             | One miniature study/example                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Stereotyping → Prejudice → Discrimination** |  Cognition (stereotype) → affect (prejudice) → behavior (discrimination). Heuristic shortcut that *can* become biased, especially when we rely on top‑down processing and representative cues. | Shapes snap judgments, policy decisions, even self‑performance (stereotype threat).        | Stereotypes persist because confirmation bias steers what we notice and remember.                                                                                                 |
| **Responding to / Reducing Prejudice**        | Strategies that break automaticity or change motivation (contact, common‑ingroup identity, perspective‑taking, self‑affirmation, norm shifts).                                                 | Improves intergroup relations, mental & physical health of targets, and group performance. | Terror‑management studies: mortality reminders heighten worldview defence and bias; affirming the self or fostering cross‑group friendship blunts the spike.                      |
| **Interpersonal Aggression**                  | Any behavior intended to harm; hostile (anger‑driven) vs. instrumental (means to an end).                                                                                                      | Large personal & social costs—from school bullying to geopolitical conflict.               | Aggression rises when situational cues (heat, provocation, weapons) combine with learned scripts and weak normative constraints; strong descriptive/injunctive norms can curb it. |
| **Prosocial Behavior**                        | Voluntary actions intended to benefit another—helping, sharing, comforting, altruism.                                                                                                          | Glue of social life; predicts community health, relationship stability, even longevity.    | Positive moods, empathy, and social emotions such as guilt cue helping; habitual gratitude & altruistic values make helping more likely.                                          |


### Stereotyping, Prejudice, and Discimination. 

Stereotype - A schema—a mental shortcut or category label—that we apply to members of a group (“engineers are…,” “elderly people can’t…”). It is cognitive, fast, and often outside awareness.

Prejudice - The affective reaction (liking / disliking) linked to that stereotype. Can be automatic or deliberative; TMT research shows it can flare when death is salient and a worldview feels threatened .

Discimination: The behavioral component—action or inaction that disadvantages a target (e.g., not hiring, social exclusion).

#### How stereotypes stick

- Confirmation Bias
- Self-fulfilling prophesy
- Need for closure . uncertainty reduction. - Under time pressure or cognitive load we reachfor simple, clear cut categories.

#### Moving from stereotype to prejudice & discrimination
Motivational roots
Terror Management Theory shows that when mortality is salient, people defend their cultural worldview and derogate out‑groups, boosting prejudice 

Group identity & self‑esteem
Favoring the in‑group nourishes self‑worth; threats to self‑esteem can heighten out‑group dislike.

From thought to action
If norms permit, the negative affect (prejudice) translates into behavioral discrimination—e.g., avoidance, exclusion, aggression.

### Responding to prejudice:
### Responding to prejudice in the moment

| What keeps prejudice alive?                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | What you can do right then                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Automatic snap‑judgments** travel the “experiential system”—fast, unconscious, stereotype‑driven thinking—unless the slower, controlled “cognitive system” is switched on. That switch requires **awareness, motivation, and cognitive capacity** . | *Pause and individuate.*  Deliberately look for fresh, situation‑specific information about the person.  When we are **motivated to know someone or feel similar to them, we naturally rely less on stereotypes and use bottom‑up processing instead** . |
| **Attribution shortcuts** such as the fundamental‑attribution error make us blame group “essences” instead of circumstances .                                                                                                                         | *Reframe the cause.*  Ask, “What situational factors might explain this behaviour?”  Simply forcing a situational explanation reduces biased judgments.                                                                                                  |
| **Confirmation bias** keeps preferred beliefs insulated from disconfirming facts .                                                                                                                                                                    | *Seek the exception.*  Actively look for (or present) clear counter‑examples—one dramatically discrepant case is often enough to trigger schema revision.                                                                                                |

### Psychological tools that *lower the temperature* of prejudice

1. **Self‑affirmation** – When people first reflect on a personally valued trait or role, they feel less identity‑threatened and become *more* open to information that challenges their group biases .
   *Classroom tip:*  Begin tense intergroup discussions with a short written “values affirmation” exercise.

2. **World‑view threat reduction (Terror‑Management Theory)** – Reminders of mortality push people to defend their cultural worldview, which can spill over as prejudice.  Buffering existential anxiety—e.g., by highlighting shared human values or symbolic forms of “immortality”—reduces that defensive backlash .

3. **Dissonance‑based “induced‑hypocrisy”** – Having participants publicly advocate egalitarian views and then recall a time they failed to live up to those views creates cognitive dissonance.  To reduce the discomfort, they often change future behaviour in a less prejudiced direction .
   *Example:*  After such an exercise, students volunteer more for diversity‑related service projects.

### Social–structural routes to **actually reducing** prejudice

| Route                                     | Key mechanism                                                                                                                                                  | Practical levers & course connections                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Contact under the right conditions**    | Replaces “us vs. them” categories with common, individuated information                                                                                        | Equal status, cooperative goals, institutional support (think *jigsaw classroom* set‑ups).  Contact also boosts perceived similarity, which we know cuts stereotyping . |
| **Norms & influence**                     | People conform to what they believe respected others approve of (social proof)                                                                                 | Make egalitarian norms loud: public pledges, visible ally badges, authority figures calling out bias.                                                                   |
| **Perspective‑taking & empathy practice** | Temporarily shifts self–other boundary, lowering implicit bias                                                                                                 | Role‑swap writing prompts; storytelling where group members share personal experiences—both raise motivation for bottom‑up processing .                                 |
| **Cognition‑friendly environments**       | Prejudice rebounds when people are tired or multitasking (low cognitive resources)                                                                             | Schedule diversity‑critical tasks (hiring meetings, grading) when participants are alert and have time. Reduce distracting time pressure.                               |
| **Ongoing self‑regulation**               | Teaching people to monitor discrepancies between egalitarian goals and actual responses—the same mechanism behind self‑control—fosters gradual bias reduction  | Use “implementation intentions” (If‑then plans: *If I catch myself making a group generalisation, then I will substitute a situational explanation*).                   |

### Interpersonal Aggression — Review (“Living Well” module context)

Although the *Living Well* deck zeroes‑in on flourishing skills like mindfulness, gratitude, and **altruism** , understanding aggression is part of the same wellness continuum: to thrive, we must recognise what derails social harmony and how to regulate it. Below is a concise review that stitches together the aggression‑relevant ideas distributed across the course slides.

| Key point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Slide connections                                                                                                                                                                           | Why it matters                                                                                        |

| **What counts as aggression?**<br>Intentional behaviour (physical, verbal, or relational) aimed at hurting someone who wants to avoid that harm. Distinguish *hostile* (hot, angry) from *instrumental* (cold, goal‑oriented) aggression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Social‐cognition material reminds us that observers often commit the Fundamental Attribution Error, over‑attributing harmful acts to bad dispositions rather than to provoking situations . | Misattributing the cause of others’ provocative behaviour can fuel an unnecessary retaliatory spiral. |
| **Internal triggers**<br>– **Emotions:** Anger, jealousy, shame. Slides on *secondary emotions* show they direct attention to norm violations and can push behaviour toward retaliation if unchecked .<br>– **Motives:** “Security” motives (avoiding threat) can override “growth” motives (approach‑oriented goals) under stress .                                                                                                                                                                     | Emotions are adaptive signals, but unmanaged anger or perceived threat primes the body for fight responses.                                                                                 |                                                                                                       |
| **Situational triggers**<br>– Social rejection/ostracism (Cyberball studies in self‑esteem deck) heightens aggressive responses toward rejecters as a way to regaining control .<br>– Norms that legitimate aggression (e.g., insults in “culture of honour” contexts) are examples of *descriptive* and *injunctive* norms learnt through social influence .                                                                                                                                            | Recognising when the *situation* is eliciting aggression protects against blaming stable traits and helps us intervene at the right leverage points (e.g., inclusion, norm change).         |                                                                                                       |
| **Social amplification**<br>Conformity, obedience, and compliance principles (Asch, Milgram) show how group pressure or authority orders can propel ordinary people into harmful acts they would not perform alone .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Many real‑world aggressions are collective; guarding against blind conformity or misplaced obedience is critical.                                                                           |                                                                                                       |
| **Cultural lenses**<br>Values, morals, and norms differ across cultures; some tolerate dominance or honour‑based retaliation more than others  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Understanding cultural scripts helps predict when aggression is socially rewarded vs. sanctioned.                                                                                           |                                                                                                       |
| **Regulation & reduction**<br>– **Emotion regulation:** Mindfulness and “challenge, not threat” appraisals in the *Living Well* deck lower physiological arousal that feeds aggression .<br>– **Counter‑norms:** Promoting prosocial norms via credible, attractive communicators (persuasion slides) can shift attitudes away from violence .<br>– **Self‑control:** Delay‑of‑gratification and cold‑processing skills (self‑regulation slides) give time for deliberation over impulsive retaliation . | The same skills that build well‑being blunt aggressive impulses—showing why *Living Well* topics belong together.                                                                           |                                                                                                       |

**Take‑away mnemonic — “STOP”**

1. **S**can the *Situation* (provocations, group norms, cultural scripts).
2. **T**une into your *Thoughts* & emotions (anger, threat appraisals).
3. **O**pen a *Pause* with self‑regulation tools (mindful breathing, reappraisal).
4. **P**ivot to a *Prosocial* response—assertive communication, problem‑solving, or third‑party support.

Mastering “STOP” not only prevents harm but clears the path for the positive counterparts you’ll study next—**prosocial behaviour** such as altruism, empathy, and cooperative helping.

## Prosocial Behavior – the “living‑well” flip‑side of aggression

### 1 What counts as prosocial behavior?

Any **voluntary act intended to benefit another person or group** — from sharing notes to donating blood. When the helper’s ultimate goal is the other’s welfare we call it **altruism** .

### 2 Why do people help?  Four complementary lenses

| Lens                              | Core idea                                                                                                           | Slide anchors                                                                                       | Exam cue                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Evolutionary**                  | Genes survive via **kin selection** and long‑run **reciprocal altruism** (help now, be helped later).               | General‑adaptation slides note humans are “social beings” whose survival depends on relationships . | A question about rescuing a sibling vs. a stranger is testing genetic relatedness.  |
| **Social‑exchange / cost‑reward** | We tally internal & external costs (time, risk) against rewards (praise, mood boost, future reciprocity).           | Norm‑of‑reciprocity and door‑in‑the‑face examples show how exchanges are cued .                     | If a vignette shows someone helping only when the costs drop, pick social‑exchange. |
| **Normative**                     | Cultures teach explicit *injunctive* (“people **ought** to help”) and *descriptive* (“most people do help”) norms . | Watch for questions that mention “everyone else was pitching in…”                                   |                                                                                     |
| **Empathy‑Altruism**              | Feeling empathic concern shifts the goal from self‑benefit to the other’s relief.                                   | Social‐emotion slides show guilt and empathy flag norm violations and motivate repair .             | If empathy is high, help even when escape is easy.                                  |

### 3 When do we help?  Classic **Latané & Darley five‑step model**

1. **Notice** the event.
2. **Interpret** as emergency (pluralistic ignorance can derail here).
3. **Assume responsibility** (diffusion of responsibility hurdle).
4. **Know** how to help.
5. **Decide & act** (audience inhibition, cost concerns).

*Slide hint*: The model itself isn’t pictured, but every step is shaped by the norms, motives, and emotions above.

### 4 Situational & personal amplifiers

| Factor                                     | Why it works                                                                                                                                            | Slide touch‑point |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Positive mood** (“feel‑good → do‑good”)  | Broadens attention, reinforces self‑concept as helpful. Persuasion slides note happy audiences agree more easily — the same spill‑over boosts helping . |                   |
| **Guilt**                                  | A social emotion that “draws attention to inappropriate behavior” and spurs repair actions .                                                            |                   |
| **Altruistic values / gratitude practice** | Built into the Living‑Well deck as paths to meaning and well‑being .                                                                                    |                   |
| **Norm of reciprocity**                    | Direct rule: “They helped me, I should help back” .                                                                                                     |                   |
| **Public commitments**                     | Hypocrisy‑induction studies show that preaching a value then recalling failures creates dissonance, leading people to volunteer more .                  |                   |

### 5 Making helping more likely (practical interventions)

1. **Assign responsibility clearly** – “*You* with the red hat—call 911!” cuts diffusion.
2. **Model helping** – seeing others aid sets descriptive norms.
3. **Teach the steps** – bystander‑intervention workshops rehearse the five‑step model.
4. **Boost empathic perspective‑taking** – short writing or imagining tasks raise later willingness to help strangers.
5. **Institutionalize gratitude & service** – class service‑learning or gratitude journals bake prosocial habits into routines.

### 6 Exam‑prep focus

| Must‑define                                             | Must‑apply                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Altruism, reciprocity norm, empathy‑altruism hypothesis | Choose the right theory when the stem manipulates **costs**, **mood**, **kinship**, or **empathy**. |
| 5‑step bystander path                                   | Spot where the chain breaks (e.g., mis‑interpretation or diffusion).                                |
| Mood & guilt effects                                    | Good‑mood helping vs. “I just broke your camera, let me help pick it up.”                           |

### Lightning practice

> *Pat is late for class when she sees a bicyclist fall. No one else is around. She hesitates, remembers she once ignored someone in need and felt bad all day, and runs over to help. Which factor best explains Pat’s decision?*
> **Answer:** The lingering **guilt** from a past norm violation primed her to repair by helping now, a “social emotion → prosocial act” pathway .

## Psyc Exam 2
### [Psyc-Exam-2](Psyc-Exam-2)

### To know from exam review:

1) After being briefly reminded of their mortality, municpal court judges rendered a significantly lower bond amount to n alledged prostitue compared to jduegs who had not been reminded?
- No.
When municipal‑court judges were reminded of their own mortality (a mortality‑salience manipulation), they became harsher, setting a much higher bond for the alleged prostitute (about $455 vs. $50 in the control condition). The finding is used in class to illustrate the Terror‑Management Theory prediction that mortality reminders intensify defense of cultural values—here, punishing behavior viewed as immoral—rather than inducing leniency. 

2) People will engage the central route of persusation when they have the motivation and ___ to think: ability.

| Term              | What it means in the Elaboration‑Likelihood Model                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Central route** | Careful, effortful processing of the arguments—people scrutinize evidence, weigh logic, and form attitudes that are durable and predictive of behavior.                                                                                                        |
| **Motivation**    | The desire to process the message (e.g., high personal relevance, accountability, or high “need for cognition”). Without wanting to think, people default to shortcuts.                                                                                        |
| **Ability**       | Having the mental resources to process: time, lack of distraction, sufficient knowledge, and a message that is **clear** enough to follow. If the content is too technical, rushed, or you’re multitasking, ability drops and the peripheral route takes over. |
| **Clarity**       | How easily the message can be understood. A clear, jargon‑free argument boosts *ability* because it reduces cognitive load; a muddy or ambiguous argument lowers ability.                                                                                      |

3) Does the better than average effect help reduce cogntive dissonance? No -> It is a self-esteem defense tactic, not in the cognitive dissonance section. 

4) What is informational social influence? We copy others behaviors when we arent sure what is correct and treat them as a factual guide to reality.

5) What is similarity influence? Messages coming from people who seem like us carrying extra weightl we give in group bias to, people like me sources more trust worthly, so their actions or arguments are more persuasive.

6)  Does pressure to conform increase with group size? Pressure to conform rises sharply as the group grows from one to about three or four people then levels off; adding a tenth person doesnt push it beyond the threshold.

7) What is the illusion of transparency? We overestimate how clearly others can see our inner feelings and thoughts.

8) potlight effect - we overestimate how much our appearance or gaffes are noticed by everyone else. 

9) What does terror management theory say about self esteem? It says it is sought because feelign that we live up to our cultures standards give symbolic protection against the anxiety of death. The idea of self esteem is a gaude of social accpetance only from sociometer theory not tmt. 

10) Why is obediance ot authority so common? Because it can be adaptive. Early socialization to respect authortiy, an evolved vias to follow credible leaders, gradual steps by steps escalation ,diffusion of responsibility when an authority claims libity and situational cutes. 

11) Scarcity as a complaice tactic is useful because they treat scarce items as opportunties or more valueable items. Out of reactance. Which is the motivation push back arising when we feel freedom is being threatended


## Psyc Exam 1
### [Psyc-Exam-1](Psyc-Exam-1)

### To know from exam reviews:

1) What is metaphoric thinking?
    - The habit of understanding an abstract idea in terms of a more concrete easier to grasp domain. Ie time is money. It works by linking the new idea to an existing schema built from past sensor and motor experience giving the brain a ready-made structre for interpreation.

2) What is a heuristic? A quick mental shortcut or rule of thumb. THe mind uses to make judgements and decisions without heavy deliberations. 

3) Do people often overemphasize the power of the situation?
- No! When judging other peoples actions they under emphasize situational forces and over credit their persionality. THis is the fundamnetal attribution error. 
  
4) Are humans cognitive misers? Yes. THe term means that we conserve mental effrt by defaulting to qucik low effort processes - heuristics, schemas, and other shortcuts. 

5) 3 conditions needed for rational cognitive systems to override experiemental ones? Awereness, motivation, capacity. 

6) Guiding principles in culture, such as benevolence, achievement, andrespect for tradition is values. 

7) Food taboos are divinity morals.
