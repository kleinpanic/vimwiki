# Physics 2206 Final Review: 

## Chapter 25 - The Reflection of Light: Mirrors: 

### 25.1 Wave fronts and rays. 
- Wave front = locus of points oscillating in phasel ray is a normal to the front and shows energy flow.
- Far from a point source the curvature is negligible -> plane waves; rays become parallel, letting us apply simple geometry for mirrors and lenses. 
  
### 25.2 Law of Reflection

Thetai = Thetar. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection given that incident and reflected angles masured from the nromal, with all three lines coplanar. 
Specular vs diffuse reflection: a polished surface preserved parallelism of rays; a rought one scambles directions. 

### 25.3 Images in a Plane Mirror. 

- A plane mirros always forms an upright, virtual, same-size image located a distance di=do behind them irror. 
- Useful geometric results: you need only a half height mirror to see your whole body. 
- Multiple reflections with intersecting mirrors can give extra images. 
  
### 25.4 Spherical Mirrors:

| Term             | Meaning                                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Principal axis* | Line through mirror midpoint and center of curvature C                |
| *Focal point* F  | Where paraxial rays converge (concave) or appear to diverge (convex)  |
| *Focal length* f | f = ½ R (for small‑angle approximation)                               |
| *Paraxial*       | Rays close to axis; only these obey the simple mirror equation.       |

Spherical Aberration: rays far from the axis miss F because a sphere isnt the ideal parabola. 

### 25.5 Ray Diagrams for Spherical Mirror: 
Concave mirror: Use three standard rays (parallel-> F, thrugh F-> parallel, through C-> back on itself) to locate the image
Convex: Same rays traced backward to F or C behind the mirror produce a dimished, upright virtualimage. 

### 25.6 Mirror Equations and Magnifications: 

Derived in the slides given: 
1/f = 1/Do + 1/Di, m = -Di/Do = Hi/hO

with sign conventions listed near the example problem (positive dᵢ for real images, negative for virtual; positive f for concave, negative for convex)

Worked example: A convex mirror with f = –46 cm and dₒ = 66 cm gives

Di = (1/F - 1/Do)^-1 ~ -27cm (virtual, behind mirror)
M ~ +0.41 (upright, 41% of object size)

### Real Vs Virtual Images 
| Feature          | **Real image**                                                                                                        | **Virtual image**                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        |
| Where rays meet  | Light **actually converges** to the image point in space. You can place a screen there and see the picture projected. | Rays only **appear to diverge** from a point behind (mirrors) or in front of (lenses) the optic; no light really comes from that point, so a screen catches nothing. |
| Ray‑tracing clue | Draw the three principal rays → they **intersect in front of** the mirror/lens.                                       | Extend the rays backward with dotted lines → their extensions intersect **behind** the mirror or on the object side of a diverging lens.                                    |
| Sign convention  | Image distance $d_i>0$ (in front of mirror / on opposite side of lens from object).                                   | $d_i<0$.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Typical sources  | Concave mirror with object outside $F$; converging lens with $d_o>f$.                                                 | Plane mirror, convex mirror, concave mirror with $d_o<F$; diverging lens always.                                                                                            |

## Chapter 26 - Refraction, Thin Lenses & Single-Lens Optics 

### Index of Reflection:
* Definition: n = c/v - the ratio of the light of speed in vacuum to its speed in a material. 
* Typical values: air: 1.0003, Water = 1.33, glass = 1.5, diamond = 2.42. 
* Physical Picture: light slows down because its electric field drives charges i nthe medium, which re-radiate and delay the wavefront. 
  
### Snell's Law of Refraction: 

n1sin(theta1) = n2sin(theta2)
Bending rule: when n2>n1 the ray bends toward the nromal; when n2<n1 it bends away. 
Apparent-depth and slap displacement problems are straight applications of snell plus a bit of geometry. 

### Total Internal Reflection (TIR)

* Occurs for light moving from higher to lower n where theta 1 > theta c.
* Critical angle: sin(theta)c = n2/n1 (with n1> n2).
* High index materials have tiny Thetac, trapping light and producing "sparkle" - it diminishes in water because n2 rises and Theta C widens. 
  
### Thin-Lens concepts:
| Lens type                                       | Sign of $f$ | Ray‑tracing facts                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                              |
| **Converging (double‑convex or plano‑convex)**  | $f>0$       | Parallel ray → focus; ray through center → undeviated; ray through object‑side focus → emerges parallel.                                                                                |
| **Diverging (double‑concave or plano‑concave)** | $f<0$       | Parallel ray appears to come from focus; through center undeviated; toward far‑side focus → emerges parallel.                                                                                                                                         |

#### 4.1 Thin-lens and Magnification Equations: 

1/f = 1/d0 + 1/di, m=-di/do = hi/ho.

| $f<d_o<2f$                        | Real, inverted                  | larger  |
| $d_o=f$                           | No image (rays emerge parallel) | —       |
| $d_o<f$                           | Virtual, upright                | larger  |

## Chapter 15: Foundation of Thermodynamics:

### 15.1 Thermodynamic Systems and Surroundings:

* System = Objects we track; all else = surrounings.
* Walls: diathermal (prevent heat) vs adiabatic (no heat).
* State is specified by variables such as P, V, T, n.

### 15.2: Zeroth law and temperature:
* If A is the Thermal Equilibrium with B and B with C, then A with C.
* Temp is the single-valued parameter labeling those equilibria.

## Chapter 18 - Electric Forces and Electric Fields. 

### 18.1-18.4: Charge,Conservation and Materials:
Elctric charge is a quantized in units of e = 1.6x10-19 Coloums (C) and is conserved in every process.
Conductors allow charge to move freely, insulators do not. 

### Coulomb's Law

F = K|q1q2|/r^2

The electrostatic force acts along the line joining two point chargesl it is attractive for unlike charges, and replsive for like signs. 
Variables - F force(N); k = 8.99x10^9 q1,q2 charges (C), r is center to center seperation
Superposition: net force is the vector sum of individual coulomb forces. 

### 18.6 Electric Field E

E = F/Qo

Where Q0 is the small positive test charge for a single point charge however
E = K |q|/r^2
Directed radially outward (q>0) or inward (q<0).
Field-line rules: line start on +, end on -; density is proportional to the |E|; never cross.

### 18.9 Electric Flux and Gauss's Law:

Electfic Flux through a surface S:
ΦE =∮SE⋅dA(N\cdotpm^2/C)

Gauss's Law:
ΦE = Qenc/E0

## Chapter 19: Potential and Potential Energy.

### Potential Energy -> Potential
* Eletric Potential ENergy U is the mechanical energy associated with an eletric force.
* Eletric Potential V at a point is energy per unit charge:
    * V = U / Qo
So a 1 volt drop means 1 joule of potential energy is released per coulomb of chagre.
* Eletron-volt: 1eV = 1.60 x e-19 J
* Motion rule: a poitive charge accelerates from higher toward lower potential; a negative charge does the opposite. 

### Potnetial difference from point charges:
Superposition makes potentials add as scalers:
* V = k q/r. k = 8.99 x e9 N. 
Use a zero reference at infinity and sum Vi for many charges. 
Type tasks: "Find the location(s) where the net potential is zero" 

### Equipotential Surfaces & The E-V link. 

An equipotential surface has the same V everywhere; no work is done moing a charge along it. 
The eletric field is perpendicular to every equipotential and points in the direction of decreasing V. 
Relationship for uniform fields is as follows:
E = DeltaV / D (Magnitude) 
Slides use this to find the spacing between two colored equipotential planes inside a parallel-plate capacitor. 

### Capacitors & Dielectrics 

#### 4.1 Definition and Basic Relation

C = Q / DeltaV (farad = CV^-1)

Charge on each plate is proportional to the applied potential difference. 

#### 4.2 Parallel-plate Capacitor. 

C = EoA / d
Where A is plate area and d seperation. 
 
#### 4.3 Dielectrics 
Inserting a dielectric (constant k) multiplies capacitance:

Cfield = kCvac

#### 4.4 Energy Storage 

Ucap = 1/2C(DeltaV)^2 = 1/2 Q^2/C

Energy density inside a filled capacitor u = 1/2 eE^2.

## Chapter 20: Electric Currents & Simple DC Circuits 

### Electromotive Force (emf) and Electric Currnt 

* emf is the maximum potential difference a source can maintain between its terminas. It is an energy-per-unit charge agent, not a force in the dynamic sense.
* Current (I) is the charge flow per unit time.

I = Delta Q / Delta T

With the ampere A = Cs^-1 as its SI unit. Conventional current assumes positive charge motion; actual elecron flow is the opposite however.

### Ohm's law and resistance 

V = IR
For a given conductor at a fixen temperature te ratio V/I is constant (Ohm's law).

Microscopic origin: 

R = p L/A
where p is the material's resistivitly, L is length, and A is cross sectional area.

### electric power. 

Whenver a current flows across a potential difference, electrical energy is converted at the rate 

P = IV = I^2R = V^2 / R

Measured in watts(W).

### Series & Parallel Connections (Single-Loop circuits)

#### Resistors
| Wiring                      | Condition                              | Equivalent resistance                                        |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Series** (same current)   | $I$ identical through each device      | $R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + \dots$                          |
| **Parallel** (same voltage) | Each branch shares the source voltage  | $\displaystyle \frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \sum \frac{1}{R_i}$ |

#### Capacitors
| Wiring   | Equivalent capacitance                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Series   | $\displaystyle \frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \sum \frac{1}{C_i}$ |
| Parallel | $C_{\text{eq}} = C_1 + C_2 + \dots$                          |

#### RC Circuits (Single Capacitor + Resistor +battery/Switch)

After a switch closes at t = 0:
Charging Vc(T) = E(1-e^-t/T), i(5) = E/R e^-t/T
Discharging Vc(T) = VoE^-t/T, I(t) = V0/R e^-t/T

With the time constant T = RC. The capacitor reaches 63$ of its final voltage in one T, gie T is practically complete.

**Clarifying chapters to review**

The user wants a review of multiple PowerPoint presentations, namely chapters 21, 22, 24, 28, 29, 30, and 31. Wait, we already did Chapter 21 earlier, didn't we? Let me check the previous conversation—yes, it looks like we’ve already reviewed Chapter 21 on Magnetism… So, the remaining chapters are 22, 24, 28, 29, 30, and 31. I'll focus on those and provide a detailed, human-readable review.

**Clarifying review requirements**

It seems the user wants a detailed, human-readable review for chapters 21, 22, 24, 28, 29, 30, and 31, free of content markers like \boxed or weird citation indices. We're aiming for a clean format, with equations possibly typed in TeX style (e.g., \$a = b\$), but no trailing index numbers. However, citations must still be included to comply with the policy, using a plain format like (website). I'll take care to ensure the output meets both clarity and citation rules.

**Crafting Chapter Reviews**

I need to create detailed yet human-readable reviews for each chapter (21, 22, 24, 28, 29, 30, 31). There will be sections covering major topics, key equations with inline variable definitions, and a variable legend at the end. I'll reference previously loaded slide content and include citations (e.g., from file references). For clarity, I will avoid misquotes or incorrect formatting like previous issues with citations. I'll evaluate each chapter step-by-step, ensuring everything meets the guidelines and is within the word limit. Let's start drafting the reviews for each chapter.

## Chapter 21 — Magnetic Forces & Magnetic Fields

*(all statements drawn from Cutnell & Johnson Ch 21 lecture slides) *

### 21.1  Magnetic Fields

* A magnetic field **B** surrounds every moving charge or magnet; compass north poles point in the field direction.
* Field‑line rules: lines leave N poles, enter S poles, never cross; density ∝ |B|.
* SI unit: tesla (T) = N s C⁻¹ m⁻¹.

### 21.2  Force on a Moving Charge

$F = q\,v\,B\,\sin\theta$ (q = charge, v = speed, θ = angle between **v** and **B**).
Right‑Hand Rule 1: fingers → **B**, thumb → **v**; palm pushes positive charge (opposite for e⁻).

### 21.3  Charged‑Particle Motion

For θ = 90° the path is a circle:
radius $r = \dfrac{m\,v}{|q|B}$ ; period $T = \dfrac{2\pi m}{|q|B}$.
Velocity selector balances **E** and **B** so only particles with $v = E/B$ pass straight.

### 21.4  Mass Spectrometer (single‑stage)

Combining selector and circular region gives $m = \dfrac{q\,B\,r}{E}$.

### 21.5  Force on a Straight Current

$F = I\,L\,B\,\sin\theta$ (L = vector length along current). Loudspeakers and rail guns use this.

### 21.6  Torque on a Current Loop

Magnetic moment $\mu = N\,I\,A$.  Torque $\tau = \mu\,B\,\sin\phi$ tries to align the loop’s normal with **B** (basis of dc motors).

### 21.7  Fields Produced by Currents

* Long straight wire: $B = \dfrac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$ (Right‑Hand Rule 2 for direction).
* Center of circular loop: $B = \dfrac{\mu_0 I}{2R}$.
* Solenoid (n turns per metre): $B = \mu_0 n I$.
  *(Ampère’s‑law derivations are out of exam scope.)*

## Chapter 22 — Electromagnetic Induction

*(slides Ch 22) *

### 22.1  Induced emf & Current

A changing magnetic environment creates an induced emf ε and, in a closed path, an induced current.

### 22.2  Motional emf

Moving a conductor of length L perpendicular to a uniform **B** gives
ε = B L v.
Energy comes from the external agent maintaining motion.

### 22.3  Magnetic Flux

$\Phi_B = B\,A\,\cos\theta$ — number of field lines through the surface.

### 22.4  Faraday’s Law

Average emf for N‑turn coil:
$\displaystyle \varepsilon = -N\,\frac{\Delta\Phi_B}{\Delta t}$.
(The minus sign is Lenz’s law.)

### 22.5  Lenz’s Law

The induced current’s own field opposes the flux change (easy way: “think negative feedback”).

### 22.7  Electric Generator (single‑loop)

Rotating area A in **B** with angular speed ω gives
ε(t) = N B A ω sin ωt.

### 22.8  Inductance

Self‑induced emf: ε\_L = −L (di/dt).
Energy stored: U = ½ L I²; energy density u = ½ B²/μ₀.

### 22.9  Transformers

$ \dfrac{V_s}{V_p} = \dfrac{N_s}{N_p},\qquad \dfrac{I_s}{I_p} = \dfrac{N_p}{N_s}$.
Only works with alternating current (constantly changing flux).

## Chapter 24 — Electromagnetic Waves

*(slides Ch 24) *

### 24.1  Nature of EM Waves

Oscillating electric and magnetic fields sustain each other and travel at
c = 3.00 × 10⁸ m s⁻¹ in vacuum.
Fields are mutually perpendicular and perpendicular to propagation; |E|/|B| = c.

### 24.2  Electromagnetic Spectrum

c = f λ links frequency f and wavelength λ.
Visible light spans roughly 400 nm (violet) to 750 nm (red).

### 24.4  Energy Transport

Time‑average intensity
$ I = \tfrac12 c\,\varepsilon_0 E_0^{2} = \tfrac12 \dfrac{c}{\mu_0} B_0^{2}$.

### 24.5  Doppler Effect (light)

For relative speed v along the line‑of‑sight (v ≪ c):
$ \dfrac{\Delta f}{f} \approx \pm \dfrac{v}{c}$.

### 24.6  Polarization

* Unpolarized light: random **E** directions.
* Linear polarizer passes one component; analyzer at angle θ transmits
  $ I = I_0 \cos^{2}\theta$ (Malus’ law).
* Crossed filters (θ = 90°) extinguish light; inserting a 45° sheet permits some transmission.

## Chapter 28 — Special Relativity (exam scope)

*(slides Ch 28) *

### 28.2  Postulates

1. **Relativity:** physics laws identical in every inertial frame.
2. **Light‑speed:** c is the same for all inertial observers.

### 28.3  Time Dilation

Moving clock ticks slower:
Δt = γ Δτ, γ = 1 / √(1 – v²/c²).
Δτ (proper time) measured in the clock’s own rest frame.

### 28.4  Length Contraction

Length along motion shrinks:
L = L₀ / γ.
Transverse dimensions unchanged.

### Choosing the Primed Frame

By convention the primed axes travel with the object moving at speed v relative to the “lab” frame; proper quantities are those measured in that rest frame.

## Chapter 29 — Photons, de Broglie Waves & Uncertainty

*(slides Ch 29) *

### 29.2  Black‑Body Radiation

Energy is emitted in quanta: E = h f (h = 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J s).
Wave–particle duality means light sometimes acts like a photon.

### 29.3  Photoelectric Effect

A photon frees an electron if h f exceeds the work function φ:
$ K_{\text{max}} = h f - \phi$.
Threshold frequency f₀ = φ/h.

### 29.4  Photon Momentum & Compton Effect

Photon momentum p = h/λ = E/c.
Scattering from electrons lengthens wavelength (Δλ = h/m\_ec (1 - cos θ)).

### 29.5  de Broglie Wavelength

Matter waves: λ = h / p = h / (m v).
Wave effects obvious only when λ comparable to object size (electrons, neutrons).

### 29.6  Heisenberg Uncertainty

Position–momentum: Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2 (ħ = h/2π).
Energy–time: ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2.

## Chapter 30 — The Bohr Model for Hydrogen

*(slides Ch 30; only exam‑relevant sections) *

### 30.1–30.2  Background

Rutherford scattering showed a tiny nucleus; hydrogen line spectrum has discrete wavelengths (Lyman, Balmer, Paschen series).

### 30.3  Bohr Postulates

* Electron orbits are circular with quantized angular momentum $L = n\,\hbar$.
* Stable orbits have radii
  $ r_n = n^{2} a_0$, $a_0 = 0.529 Å$.
* Energy levels
  $ E_n = -13.6\,\text{eV}/n^{2}$.
  Photon emission/absorption obeys
  $ h f = E_i - E_f$.

### 30.3  Ionization & Series Limits

Ionization energy of hydrogen: 13.6 eV (n → ∞).
Series limit wavelength for Balmer: use ΔE between n = 2 and ∞.

### 30.4  de Broglie Insight

Standing‑wave condition $n\lambda = 2\pi r$ explains Bohr’s angular‑momentum rule.

*(Quantum‑mechanical orbitals, X‑rays, lasers, etc. are outside this exam’s scope.)*

## Chapter 31 — Nuclear Physics & Radioactivity

*(slides Ch 31) *

### 31.1  Nuclear Structure

Atomic number Z (protons); mass number A (protons + neutrons).
Isotopes: same Z, different N.

### 31.2  Strong Nuclear Force & Stability

Proton repulsion grows with A; extra neutrons add attraction without charge, widening stability belt.

### 31.3  Mass Defect & Binding Energy

Nuclear mass is less than the mass of separated nucleons;
binding energy $B = (\Delta m)\,c^{2}$.
1 atomic‑mass‑unit (u) deficit equals 931 MeV of binding energy.

### 31.4  Radioactive Decay

* α: A → A – 4, Z → Z – 2 (helium nucleus).
* β⁻: neutron → proton + e⁻ + $\bar{\nu}_e$; Z increases by 1.
* β⁺: proton → neutron + e⁺ + ν\_e; Z decreases by 1.
* γ: nucleus de‑excites without changing A or Z.

### 31.6  Decay Law & Activity

Number of nuclei $N(t) = N_0\,e^{-\lambda t}$.
Half‑life $t_{1/2} = \ln 2 / \lambda$.
Activity $A = \lambda N$ (unit: becquerel = 1 decay s⁻¹).

### 31.7  Radio‑Dating

e.g., C‑14 (t½ = 5730 yr) useful for archaeological timescales; isotopes with very long or very short half‑lives are not.
