# Feedback On the Research Paper

## Thesis Evaluation

* **Thesis Statement**: "This article examines the relationship between the emotional appeals of charity campaigns and their impact on donors."
* **Partner's Name**: Aujin
* **Feedback**: The thesis is clear about the purpose of the paper, but it lacks any supporting thesis material, like what he suspects the outcome will be and why. It is clear that it focuses on emotional appeals, and their role in charity campaigns but it is somewhat broad, and does not fully articulate the paper's analytical or argumentative scope. While it indicates that there is a focus on emotional appeals, it does not specify the comparative analysis between guilt and hope, which becomes central later in the paper. The thesis lacks precision in defining the purpose or argument- such as weather guilt or hope is more effective, under what circumstances, or how social media actuall affects these appeals. The thesis could better frame the argument, emphasizing not just exploration but also the actionable insights or conclusions derived from the research.  

## Introduction Analysis:

* **Clear Line of research**: The paper has no clear defined section for introduction, but they do have an abstract so I will be treating them the same. The abstract and opening lines provide a broad overview of the paper's focus which is the role of emotional appeals in social media-driven charity campaigns. There is a mention of key emotional triggers, their differing impact, and the connection to social media campaigns. That being said the abstract/introduction lacks a focused, cohesive hook to orient the reader. While the abtract does provide an overview, it does not transition smoothly into an introduction of the research line. The specific aims of this paper (exploring the mechanisms of emotional appeal, their effectiveness in different contexts, and actionable outcomes) are not made explicity clear early on. There is also no clear statement about why this research maters or what gap it fills in existing literature. 
* **Background information**: The abstract briefly introductes key emotional appeals and mentions their effects. Secondary data sources and methodologies are referenced. THat being said the background info is fragmented and assumes the reader has prior knowledge of emotional triggers and their application in charity campaigns. For example, the bastract mentions emotional appeals like guilt and hope without defining them or explaining their relevance to charity work. The role of social media is introduced but not contextualized enoguh. Why is social media particularly impactful for emotional appeals? This would need to be better elaborated on early on. 
* **Overall fidings**: The paper lacks a clear and cohesive introduction. The abstract does provide some context, but it does not function as an effective introduction because it fails to frame the research question, provide sufficent background, or create a strong transition to the thesis of the paper. I recommend adding a hook, providing defintiions and backgrounds, adding an introducton, make sure this introduction frames the research and bridges the thesis statement. 

## Organization Evaluation
* **Transitions between topics**: There is reasonable flow between broader sections of the paper, The order logically makes sense. Within sections however, transitions are often abrupt or unclear, for example the literature review moves from discussing guilt appeals to transparency and social media's role without clearly tying these ideas together. This creates a fragmented feel in the paper. The "Case Studies" section could use stronger transitons to tie examples together and back to the main argument. For instance how does the "save the children Syria Crisis Appeal" example reinforce the findings about guilt-based appeals? This is never explicitly made clear and is left to the reader to interpet and speculate. 
* Flow Between the topics: The paper generally progresses logically. There is a coherent narrative that consistently focuses on guilt and hope as emotional appeals. With hat in mind the flow is occasionally disrupted by overly long quotes or dense blocks of information,particulalry in the literature review. For example, extended descriptions of studies could be summarized more concisely. The discussion sections integrates findings but does not consistently tie them back to the thesis or the main argument. 
* Paragraphs: Most paragrpahs are well developed and provide detail. Some paragrpahs however try to cover too many ideas as once, making them dense and harder to follow for instance the Discussion section where one paragraph jumps between micro-targeting, transparency,and emotional messaging. Conversely some paragraphs in the "methodology" section are underdeveloped and could be better fleshed out. 
  
## Research Evaluation
* Clarity of Research Arguments and persuasion: The research argument is generally clear: guilt based appeals are more effective for eleciting immediate donations during crises while hope based appeals are better for foresting long-term donor engagement. The thesis remains consistent. The argument could be more persuavive by directlying addressing counterarguments or limitations. For instance while guilt-based appeals are argued to be effective for immediate donations, there's litter discussion of potential donor fatigue or ethical concerns associated with these tactics. The argument about hope-based appeals could be more robust, with more specific examples of campaigns that successfully used hope to secure long-term commitments.
* **Effectiveness of Source placement**: Sources are integrated throughout the paper to supprot claims which is great. Some sources however are mentioned without fully integrating them into the argument. For example the mention of Eckert et al. on transparency and donor trust feels underdeveloped. The paper relies heavily on a few key sources without diversifying its evidence base. 
* **Flow Between Sources**: Sources generally flow well withint sections. However, in some cases, te connection between sources is unclear or forced. For example, the discussion of emotional storytelling could better link to the broader argument about social media's role in enhancing emotional appeals. 
* **Main Arguments and CounterArguments**:
    * *Main Arguments*:
        * Guilt-Based Appeals drives Immediate donations during crises: This is supported by Zhou Et Al which demonstrates how guilt-based imagery during faminine campaigns elicts quick responses.
        * Hope-Based appeals foster long-term donor commitment: This is supported by Zhour et all, and the UNHCR campaign example highlight how hope-based appeals sustain donor engagement over time, particularly in post-crisis recovery.
        * Socal Media Enhances the effectiveness of both guilt and hope appeals by enabling targeted emotional driving campaigns: This is supported by Bilgin and Kethuda which shows how social media's targeting capabilities amplify emotional messaging.
    * *Counterarguments*:
        * Overuse of Guilt-based appeals may lead to donor fatique or ethical concenrs: This paper does not adequately address this counterargument. While it acknowledges the power of guilt-based appeals, it does not explore the risks or ethical considerations of relying on these tactics.
        * Hope-based appeals may be less effective for urgent crisis: This paper does support this counterargument by showing that guilt-based appeals are better suited for immediate fundraising. However, it does not fully explore situations where hope-based appeals might still be effective in crises.
        * Social media campaigns may exclude older or less tech-savvy donors: This potential limitation is not addressed which leaves a gap in the argument.
* **Exploration and Development of Elements**: The paper effectively explores nuaces of guilt and hope appeals, providing evidence and examples for each. Regardless, counterarguments and limitations are not fully developed. Some sections like case studies could more explicitly tie their findings back to the main argument.
      
      
## Citation Evaluation
* **Correct Format for Summaries and Paragraphs**: Summaries and paragraphs are generally well-written and clearly ncorporate information from cited sources. Paraphrased content maintans original meaning and integrates seamlessly into the text without over-reliance on direct quotations. Some paragraphs are lengthy and could benefit from further condensaton or rephrasing for clarity. For instance the summary of Biligin and Kethuda's findings on social media includes too many details that could be summarized more succinctly. The distinction between paraphrased ideas and original analysis is not always clear. Occsaionally the text transitions aburptly, making it harder to discern whether certain points are drawn from a source or the author's interpretation. 
* **Textual Citations from Sources**: Textual citations are included for most secodnary sources, ensuring the reader can trace back the claims to their original studies. However not all sources listed in the references are cited in the text. For example, while "Donately Blog" appears in the bibliography, its insights are not clearly cited in the body of the paper. Some citations could be more precise. For instance, statements that synthesize multiple studies should include all relevant citations instead of relying on a single reference. 
* **Citing Fieldwork Sources**: Fieldwork sources such as the survey data and interviews with participants are citated effectively. The paper includes anonumized quotes from interviewees that clearly align with the findings from the survey. Wheil the fieldwork is cited, the methodology section does not clearly link the data collection process to the specific findings presented. 
* **Consistency and Format**: The citations are consistent however they seem to flip flop in some areas between MLA and APA, most of which seems to be in APA format. Some intext citations lack key details needed like page numbers. The formatting of the reference list is inconsistent with some entries acking sufficent detail, and varying URL placement. 

## Grammar/Style Evaluation: 

### Common Errors: 

* Run on Sentences: Some sentences are overly long and include multiple ideas that could be seperated for example:
    * Social media enhances these emotional demands and allows targeted messaging to reach its intended audience, fostering a sense of engagement and connection" could be split into two sentences to improve clarity.
* Wordiness: Several sentences are verbose and could be streamlined for example:
    * "Emotional storytelling is especially compelling when it renders the franticness of natural disasters or economic hardship tangible for the audience to empathize with" could be simplified to: "Emotional storytelling is compelling when it makes disasters or hardships relatable to the audience."
* Repetition: Ideas about guilt-based and hope-based appeals are repeated without adding new insights. 
  
### Use of Passive Voice

* Passive voice is avoided in most cased however some sentences unnecessarily use the passive voice, making them less direct for example:
    * "It is suggested by Zhou et al. (2024) that guilt-based appeals are more effective during crises" could be revised to: "Zhou et al. (2024) suggest that guilt-based appeals are more effective during crises."

### Conciseness

* Most paragraphs convey detailed info without being overly terse however several sections include reduction explanations of concepts already discussed for example, the repeated explanation of how guilt-based appeals elicit immediate donations detracts from the flow of the argument. Additionally the paper has overuse of prepositional phrases and qualifiers adding unnecessary length for example:
    * "The emotional connection that is created by these appeals through the use of social media is extremely powerful" could be revised to: "Social media makes emotional appeals powerful."

### Avoidance of Vague Language

* Some phrases are vague or over general, making the argument less precise for example:
    * "Social media enhances these emotional demands" could be clarified by specifying how social media enhances emotional demands (e.g., by targeting specific audiences or using algorithmic personalization).

## Summation

This project examines the impact of emotiona appeal - specifically guilt and hope - in charitable giving, focusing on their application in social media campaigns. It argues that guilt-base appeals are highly effective for immediate fundraising during crises, while hope-based appeals foster long term donor engagement. This paper also highlights the transformative role of social media in targeting and amplifying these appeals using primary research and secondary research to support its claims.

### Positives:

* **Focsed and Relevant topics**: THe paper tackles an important and timely issue - how emotional appeals influence charitable givings in the digital age.
* Logical Structure: The pper is well organized at a high level, moving logically from one paragraph to another.
* **Clear Focus**: The central comparison between guilt and hope appeals is consistently maintained ensuring the paper stays on time

### Improvement

* **Thesis and Introduction**: The thesis could be specified and analytic, emphasing the paper's key focus. The paper lacks a formal itroductio nthat frames the research question and provides necessary context. Adding this would strength the overall structue a lot.
* **Transition and Flow**: Transitions between paragrahs and sections are sometimes abrupt, and disrupt the flow. Some sectins also feel disjointed such as the literature view. 
* **Counterarguments and limitations**: Paper does not sufficiently address potential counteragruments or limitations. 
* **Conciseness and Clarity**: Some sentences and paragraphs are overly long or repetitive. Simplifying the language and eliminating redudant points would help a lot. Vague langauge also is consistent throughout like "emotional demands", "enhances these appeals" should be replaced with specific descriptions.
* **Citation issues**: Some sources in the bibliograph are not cited in the text and the formatting of some sources is off. 
* **Fieldwork integration**: The primary research findings from surveys and interviews are not deeply analyzed or consistently tied to the central argument. For example, specific trends in survey data could be more explicitly linked to the effectiveness of guilt and hope appeals. 

### Specific Improvements

1. **Revise the thesis and add an introduction**:
    * Create a formal introduction that includes a clear research question, context, and thesis statement. Revise the thesis to emphasize key findings, such as: "Guilt-based appeals elicit immediate donations during crises, while hope-based appeals foster long-term engagement. Social media enhances both strategies, making them essential tools for modern fundraising."
2. **Strengthen Transitions**:
    * Use transition sentences to link ideas between paragraphs and sections. For example, when moving from literature review to methodology, explicitly state how prior research informed the chosen methods.
3. **Address Counterarguments**:
    * Discuss potential downsides of emotional appeals (e.g., donor fatigue, ethical concerns) and limitations of social media campaigns. This would add depth to the analysis.
4. **Tighten Lanuage**:
    * Eliminate wordiness and redundancy. Focus on concise, impactful sentences. Clarify vague terms and provide specific examples to support general statements.
5. **Integrate Fieldwork More Effectively**:
    * Analyze survey and interview data in greater detail, connecting specific findings to the argument about emotional appeals. 
6. **Fix Citation issues**:
    * Ensure all sources in the bibliography are cited in the text. Standardize citation formatting and include missing details (e.g., page numbers, DOIs, retrieval dates).
