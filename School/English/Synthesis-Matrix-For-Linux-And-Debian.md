# Synthesis Matrix for Linux and Debian research

## Overview: 

> I used my brook notes for this document. 

### To view the File: 
- Greetings Professor, This is a markdown file. I've submitted one before but this is how I take my notes. Markdown files are cool because they can be converted into HTML very easily and be previewed as a webpage which I find pretty neat. For this matrix I did a markdown table. The plaintext of this file looks rather weird I am sure so the best way to view this file is using:
    - **MarkText**: This is am open-source Mardown editor and viewer for Macos, and Windows and Linux. [Source](https://www.marktext.cc/)
    - **NVIM**: I use this. I don't recommend it.
    - **markdownlivepreview.com**: This is a webpage you can compy and paste this file and see how it looks normally / on a webpage. I recommend this as you don't have to download anything.
- For your convience I will also submit a DOCX.
