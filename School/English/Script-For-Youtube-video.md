### **Introduction (1-2 mins)**

**Script:**
1. **On Camera:**
"Hey everyone, I’m [Your Name], and today we’re going on an exciting journey into the depths of Linux and, more specifically, the Debian distribution. Whether you’re a Linux enthusiast, a sysadmin, or just curious about what powers so much of the tech world, this video is for you. We’re going to explore how the Linux kernel, often called the ‘heart’ of any Linux-based system, operates behind the scenes to make your hardware and software work together seamlessly."

[Pause and gesture slightly for emphasis]

"Now, let’s talk about why Debian is special. Debian isn’t just another Linux distribution—it’s a cornerstone in the open-source ecosystem. Known for its stability, security, and vast package repository, Debian has been around since the early 90s, powering servers, desktops, and even embedded systems. But what sets it apart is how it tailors the Linux kernel to meet its philosophy of reliability and versatility."

[Smile and maintain an engaging tone]

"Over the next few minutes, I’ll be breaking down the Linux kernel’s architecture and showing you real examples of how Debian handles things like process scheduling, memory management, and even real-time optimizations. But this isn’t just going to be me talking—this is hands-on. I’ll be running commands in the terminal, showing you diagrams, and even diving into source code to really uncover the magic."

[Lean forward slightly, as if confiding in the audience]

"Why is this important? Understanding these details gives you the power to not only use Linux but to tweak it, optimize it, and maybe even contribute back to the community. So whether you’re new to Linux or a seasoned pro, stick around—I promise you’ll learn something new."

Would you like help preparing additional demos for specific kernel subsystems, such as file systems or the network stack?

### **Enhanced Deep Dive into Process Scheduling (4-5 mins)**

---

#### **Script**

1. **On Camera:**
   - "Process scheduling is one of the most critical tasks in an operating system, and Linux handles this with a component called the Completely Fair Scheduler, or CFS. It’s designed to ensure that CPU time is allocated fairly across tasks, making efficient use of hardware while maintaining responsiveness."
   - "Let’s break this down and examine how CFS uses data structures like red-black trees to achieve fairness. We’ll also simulate real-world CPU load to see the scheduler in action."

---

#### **In-depth Terminal Commands and Demos**

---

**Step 1: Understanding the Scheduler**

**Show the Current Scheduler**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  cat /sys/kernel/debug/sched_features
  ```
- Output Example:
  ```
  GENTLE_FAIR_SLEEPERS START_DEBIT TTWU_QUEUE
  NO_GENTLE_FAIR_SLEEPERS NEXT_BUDDY
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "This output shows the features enabled in the scheduler. For example, `GENTLE_FAIR_SLEEPERS` ensures that sleeping processes don’t miss out on CPU time when they wake up."
  - "The scheduler dynamically adapts to system conditions based on these parameters."

---

**Step 2: Visualizing the Scheduling Algorithm**

**Enhanced Diagram**
- Create a file to visualize the CFS mechanism:
  ```bash
  cat << 'EOF' > cfs_mechanism.txt
  +-------------------------------+
  |          Task Pool            |
  |  (Processes in the system)    |
  +-------------------------------+
             |
             v
  +-------------------------------+
  |    Red-Black Tree (CFS)       |
  |                               |
  |  Process A (vruntime = 10)    |
  |  Process B (vruntime = 15)    |
  |  Process C (vruntime = 20)    |
  +-------------------------------+
             |
             v
  +-------------------------------+
  |      Next Task to Run         |
  |      (Smallest vruntime)      |
  +-------------------------------+
  EOF
  ```
- Display the diagram:
  ```bash
  cat cfs_mechanism.txt
  ```

**Explanation (On Camera):**
- "The CFS uses a red-black tree, where processes are ordered by their virtual runtime. Processes with the least runtime are selected to run next. This ensures that no single task dominates the CPU, promoting fairness across all tasks."

---

**Step 3: Examining the Source Code**

**Show and Explain CFS Code**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  less /usr/src/linux-source-6.1/kernel/sched/fair.c
  ```
- Focus on this function:
  ```c
  static struct task_struct *pick_next_task_fair(struct rq *rq,
                                                 struct task_struct *prev,
                                                 struct rq_flags *rf)
  {
      struct sched_entity *se = pick_next_entity(&rq->cfs);
      if (!se)
          return NULL;

      put_prev_task(rq, prev);
      set_next_entity(&rq->cfs, se);

      return task_of(se);
  }
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "This function, `pick_next_task_fair`, is at the heart of the scheduler. It identifies the next task to run based on the virtual runtime stored in the red-black tree. This ensures that tasks with less CPU time are prioritized, balancing system responsiveness."

---

**Step 4: Simulating CPU Load**

**Run a CPU Stress Test**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  stress-ng --cpu 4 --timeout 20s &
  ps -eo pid,comm,cls,pri,ni | grep stress-ng
  htop
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "Using `stress-ng`, I’m creating artificial CPU load across four cores. In `htop`, you can see how the scheduler distributes CPU time evenly, ensuring no single task monopolizes resources."

---

**Step 5: Monitoring Scheduling Metrics**

**Trace Scheduler Events**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  sudo trace-cmd record -e sched_switch
  sudo trace-cmd report | less
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "The `sched_switch` event captures context switches between processes. Here, we can see which tasks were switched and their priority levels. This gives us insight into how the scheduler works in real time."

---

**Step 6: Tuning the Scheduler**

**Adjust CFS Parameters**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  cat /proc/sys/kernel/sched_min_granularity_ns
  sudo sysctl kernel.sched_min_granularity_ns=5000000
  cat /proc/sys/kernel/sched_min_granularity_ns
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "The `sched_min_granularity_ns` parameter controls the minimum time a task gets on the CPU. By increasing it, we give tasks more time to execute before switching, which can improve performance for compute-heavy workloads."

---

### **Wrap-Up for This Section**

1. **On Camera:**
   - "The Completely Fair Scheduler is a masterpiece of efficiency and fairness, ensuring that all processes get a fair share of CPU time while maintaining responsiveness. Through tools like `stress-ng`, `trace-cmd`, and tuning parameters, we can better understand and optimize how the Linux kernel handles process scheduling."
   - "Next, we’ll dive into how the kernel manages memory—another critical aspect of its performance."

Would you like further details about how to prepare these demos or additional scheduler-related tuning examples?

  |  |         1MB Block       |  |
  |  +-------------------------+  |
  +-------------------------------+
            Split on Demand
  +-------------------------------+
  |  +------+      +------+       |
  |  | 512KB |      | 512KB |     |
  |  +------+      +------+       |
  +-------------------------------+
            Further Splits
  +-------------------------------+
  |  +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+     |

  |  +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+     |
  +-------------------------------+
        Merge on Free Blocks
  +-------------------------------+
  |  +------+      +------+       |
  |  | 512KB |      | 512KB |     |
  |  +------+      +------+       |
  +-------------------------------+
  EOF
  ```
- Display the diagram:
  ```bash
  cat buddy_system_lifecycle.txt
  ```

**Explanation (On Camera):**
- "The buddy system is efficient because it splits memory into power-of-two blocks. It minimizes fragmentation and speeds up allocation by splitting and merging blocks dynamically."

---

#### **Step 2: Source Code Analysis**

**Navigate Kernel Source Code**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  less /usr/src/linux-source-6.1/mm/page_alloc.c
  ```
- Focus on `__alloc_pages`:
  ```c
  struct page *__alloc_pages(unsigned int order)
  {
      // Find the first free block of the requested size
      for (each block size >= order) {
          if (free_block_found) {
              split_page(page, order);
              return page;
          }
      }
      return NULL; // No memory available
  }
  ```

**Explanation (On Camera):**
- "This function looks for the smallest available block that satisfies the memory request. If it can’t find one, it allocates the next larger block and splits it down."

---

#### **Step 3: Slab Allocator Details**

**Advanced Diagram**
- Visualize the slab allocator:
  ```bash
  cat << 'EOF' > slab_allocator_diagram.txt
  +-------------------------------+
  |         Memory Cache          |
  |  +-------------------------+  |
  |  |      Slab Cache 1       |  |
  |  | +---------------------+ |  |
  |  | | Obj | Obj | Obj |   | |  |
  |  | +---------------------+ |  |
  |  +-------------------------+  |
  |  +-------------------------+  |
  |  |      Slab Cache 2       |  |
  |  | +---------------------+ |  |
  |  | | Obj |     |     |   | |  |
  |  | +---------------------+ |  |
  |  +-------------------------+  |
  +-------------------------------+
  EOF
  ```
- Display the diagram:
  ```bash
  cat slab_allocator_diagram.txt
  ```

**Explanation (On Camera):**

  24:     10002       4500       2300        700   IO-APIC   24-edge      eth0
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "This output shows how interrupts, such as those generated by network traffic on `eth0`, are distributed across CPUs. By optimizing IRQ affinity, we can ensure that high-priority interrupts are handled on specific CPU cores."

**Set IRQ Affinity**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/irq/24/smp_affinity
  cat /proc/irq/24/smp_affinity
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "Here, I’ve assigned IRQ 24 to CPU core 2. This ensures that all interrupts for this device are handled exclusively by that core, reducing contention and latency for critical tasks."

**Monitor IRQ Performance**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  watch -n 1 cat /proc/interrupts
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "Using `watch`, I’m monitoring how interrupts are handled in real time. After changing the affinity, you can see that IRQ 24 activity is now isolated to CPU 2."

#### **Step 8: Tuning the Deadline Scheduler**

**Set and Verify Scheduler**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  echo deadline | sudo tee /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
  cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
  ```
- **Output Example:**
  ```
  [deadline] cfq noop
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "The deadline scheduler prioritizes I/O requests with deadlines, ensuring that time-sensitive applications receive the resources they need. Unlike CFQ (Completely Fair Queueing), which aims for fairness, the deadline scheduler focuses on predictability."

**Monitor I/O Performance**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  iostat -x 1 5
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "The `iostat` command provides a detailed breakdown of disk utilization and request times. With the deadline scheduler enabled, you’ll notice reduced latency for I/O operations under load."

  - "Here, `perf stat` profiles how often real-time tasks are woken up and switched. This data helps identify bottlenecks and ensures the scheduler is meeting real-time requirements."

---

#### **Step 10: Advanced Debugging with `ftrace`**

**Trace Kernel Functions**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  sudo echo function > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
  sudo echo sched_wakeup > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter
  sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace
  ```
- **Output Example:**
  ```
  sched_wakeup: pid=1234, prio=99
  sched_wakeup: pid=4321, prio=80
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "With `ftrace`, we can trace the `sched_wakeup` function, which is triggered when a task is moved to the run queue. This level of detail helps debug scheduling issues in real-time workloads."

**Visualize Trace Data**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  trace-cmd record -e sched_switch
  kernelshark
  ```

   - "Let’s explore these advanced concepts step by step."

---

### **Enhanced Details, Tools, and Examples**

---

#### **Step 1: Understanding NUMA Optimization**

**What is NUMA?**
- Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architectures separate memory into zones tied to specific CPUs. Optimizing NUMA ensures that tasks access memory local to their CPU, reducing latency.

**Check NUMA Configuration**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  numactl --hardware
  ```
- Output Example:
  ```
  available: 2 nodes (0-1)
  node 0 cpus: 0-7
  node 1 cpus: 8-15
  node 0 size: 64 GB
  node 1 size: 64 GB
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "Here, the system has two NUMA nodes, each with 64GB of memory. Tasks running on CPUs in node 0 can access memory in that node faster than memory in node 1."

**Run a NUMA-Aware Benchmark**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  numactl --cpunodebind=0 --membind=0 sysbench --test=cpu --cpu-max-prime=20000 run
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "By binding both computation and memory to NUMA node 0, we ensure minimal latency. This approach is critical for high-performance applications like databases or computational clusters."

---

#### **Step 2: Profiling I/O Performance with `blktrace`**

**Visualize Disk Activity**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  sudo blktrace -d /dev/sda -o - | blkparse -i -
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "`blktrace` captures detailed I/O events on a disk. For example, you can see read and write operations, their latencies, and which processes initiated them."

**Run an I/O Stress Test**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  stress-ng --hdd 4 --hdd-ops 100000 --timeout 20 &
  sudo blktrace -d /dev/sda -o - | blkparse -i -
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "Here, `stress-ng` creates an artificial workload on `/dev/sda`, and `blktrace` monitors how the kernel handles these I/O requests."

---

#### **Step 3: Tuning NUMA Performance**

**Enable NUMA Balancing**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  cat /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing
  echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "NUMA balancing allows the kernel to migrate tasks and memory dynamically between nodes to optimize performance."

**Check NUMA Memory Stats**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  numastat
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "`numastat` provides a breakdown of memory usage by NUMA node. High `local` memory access indicates efficient NUMA usage, while high `remote` access suggests potential performance bottlenecks."

---

#### **Step 4: Tuning I/O Performance**

**Use Deadline Scheduler**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  echo deadline | sudo tee /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
  cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "The deadline scheduler prioritizes I/O requests based on deadlines, ensuring predictable performance for time-sensitive workloads."

**Adjust Read-Ahead Settings**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  sudo blockdev --getra /dev/sda
  sudo blockdev --setra 1024 /dev/sda
  sudo blockdev --getra /dev/sda
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "Read-ahead optimizes sequential reads by preloading data into memory. Increasing this value to 1024 sectors can improve performance for workloads with large sequential reads, like video processing."

**Measure Disk Latency**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  sudo ioping /dev/sda -c 10
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "`ioping` measures disk latency, providing a real-time view of how quickly the storage responds to requests. It’s useful for evaluating the impact of tuning changes."

---

#### **Step 5: Combined NUMA and I/O Workload**

**Simulate Realistic Workloads**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  numactl --cpunodebind=0 --membind=0 stress-ng --hdd 2 --hdd-ops 50000 --timeout 15 &
  iostat -x 1 5
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "Here, I’m combining NUMA and I/O tuning by running a disk-intensive workload on NUMA node 0 while monitoring disk utilization with `iostat`."

---

#### **Step 6: Debugging System Performance with `perf`**

**Trace I/O and NUMA Events**

**Capture and Analyze Task Latencies**
- Terminal Commands:
  ```bash
  sudo perf record -e sched:sched_latency -a -- sleep 5
  sudo perf report
  ```
- **Explanation (On Camera):**
  - "`sched_latency` tracks task latencies system-wide, providing insights into delays caused by scheduling, I/O, or memory access bottlenecks."
