# CS 1114 - Getting Started: Detailed Notes

## 1.1. Getting Started

### 1.1.1 Installing BlueJ
- BlueJ is the **integrated development environment (IDE)** used for this course.
- Follow the instructions on **Canvas** to install it correctly.

## 1.1.2 LightBot: Introduction to Programming Concepts

- **LightBot** is a browser-based simulation game that introduces programming concepts.
- Uses **icon-based programming**: Drag and drop actions to make the robot solve puzzles.
- Programming concepts introduced:
  - **Objects**: The LightBot itself is an object that follows commands.
  - **Methods**: The commands given to the LightBot are methods.
  - **Algorithms**: A sequence of steps to solve a problem.

### 1.1.3 Micro-Worlds: Understanding the Programming Environment

- **Micro-worlds** are small, simulated environments used to teach programming.
- The LightBot game follows a **grid-based system**:
  - Each **grid position is represented using (x, y) coordinates**.
  - **Left-handed Cartesian plane** (y-axis points downward).
  - **Zero-based indexing** (count starts at 0).
- Micro-worlds help visualize object interactions and movement.

## 1.1.6 Representing Programs in Text

- Programs are sequences of **instructions** for the computer.
- **Converting visual commands to text-based programming**:
  ```java
  andy.move();
  andy.turnRight();
  andy.turnLightOn();
  ```
- This transition from visual to text-based programming is fundamental to learning Java.

## 1.1.8 Key Programming Concepts

### **Objects and Classes**
- **Objects**: Self-contained units in a program with attributes and behaviors.
- **Classes**: Templates that define how objects behave.
- In LightBot, the **LightBot itself is an object**, and **LightBot is the class** that defines it.

### **Methods**
- **Methods define what an object can do**.
- Methods in LightBot include:
  ```java
  andy.move();
  andy.turnRight();
  andy.turnLightOn();
  ```
- **Method Syntax**:
  ```java
  objectName.methodName();
  ```
- **Every method must end with a semicolon (`;`)**.

### **Calling Methods**
- **To make an object perform an action, we call a method**:
  ```java
  andy.move();
  ```
- The method follows the format:
  ```java
  object.method();
  ```
- Example sequence for a LightBot to move and turn:
  ```java
  andy.move();
  andy.turnLeft();
  andy.move();
  ```

### **Creating New Objects using `new`**
- **To create a new object, use the `new` keyword**:
  ```java
  LightBot andy = new LightBot();
  ```
- This creates an **instance** of the `LightBot` class and assigns it to the variable `andy`.
- Objects must be **added to the world**:
  ```java
  this.addObject(andy, 0, 4);
  ```
- This places the LightBot **at (0,4) on the grid**.

### **Inheritance: Superclass, Subclass, and `extends`**
- **Inheritance** allows a subclass to take features from a **superclass**.
- **Superclass**: The parent class that contains common features.
- **Subclass**: A more specific version of the superclass.
- The `extends` keyword is used in Java to **inherit from a superclass**:
  ```java
  class AdvancedLightBot extends LightBot {
      // AdvancedLightBot has all LightBot features + new ones
  }
  ```

### **Writing Methods**
- Methods define **object behaviors**.
- **Basic method structure**:
  ```java
  public void myProgram() {
      LightBot andy = new LightBot();
      this.addObject(andy, 0, 4);
      andy.move();
      andy.jump();
  }
  ```

### **Method Stubs**
- A **method stub** is a placeholder method that is not yet fully implemented.
- Example of a stub:
  ```java
  public void moveForward() {
      // Implementation will go here
  }
  ```

## 1.1.9 Core Methods in LightBot

| **Method**         | **Action** |
|--------------------|-----------|
| `move()`         | Moves forward one square. |
| `turnRight()`    | Turns 90° clockwise. |
| `turnLeft()`     | Turns 90° counterclockwise. |
| `jump()`         | Jumps up/down if possible. |
| `turnLightOn()`  | Lights up a blue tile. |

---

## 1.1.12 Calling Methods on an Object
- Methods are called using **dot notation**:
  ```java
  objectName.methodName();
  ```
- Example:
  ```java
  andy.move();
  ```
- Multiple method calls can be made sequentially:
  ```java
  andy.move();
  andy.jump();
  andy.turnLeft();
  ```

---

## 1.1.14 Writing Readable Code
### **Best Practices**
1. **Use meaningful names** (e.g., `move()`, `jump()`).
2. **Use comments to explain code**:
   ```java
   // Move LightBot forward
   andy.move();
   ```
3. **Use proper indentation** (4 spaces per level).
4. **Follow Java syntax rules** (e.g., always end statements with `;`).

---

## 1.1.16 Programming Practice
- Exercises involve writing Java programs using **LightBot methods**.
- Helps transition from **icon-based programming** to **text-based programming**.

## Key Takeaways
1. **Objects and Classes**: Objects (e.g., LightBot) are instances of classes.
2. **Methods**: Define behaviors (e.g., `move()`, `jump()`).
3. **Calling Methods**: Objects perform actions via method calls (`andy.move();`).
4. **Creating Objects**: Use `new` to instantiate (`LightBot andy = new LightBot();`).
5. **Inheritance**: Subclasses inherit from superclasses using `extends`.
6. **Method Stubs**: Placeholder methods used before full implementation.
7. **LightBot Core Methods**: `move()`, `turnLeft()`, `turnRight()`, `jump()`, `turnLightOn()`.
8. **Readable Code**: Meaningful names, comments, indentation.
