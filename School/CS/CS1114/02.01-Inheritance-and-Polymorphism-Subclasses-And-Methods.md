**2.1 Inheritance and Polymorphism: Subclasses and Methods**

### **Objects and Classes**
Objects are instances of classes, which serve as blueprints for creating objects with specific attributes and behaviors. In Java, an object represents a real-world entity and can perform tasks using methods. A class defines the properties (attributes) and actions (methods) that an object can have.

In the context of the Jeroo simulator, the `Jeroo` class represents a Jeroo, which is an object that exists on Santong Island. Each Jeroo object has attributes such as its position, direction, and the number of flowers it carries. Similarly, `Island` is another class that represents the world in which Jeroos operate.

### **Methods and Calling Methods**
Methods define the actions an object can perform. To execute a method, we call it using an object and dot notation, followed by parentheses:
```java
jessica.hop();
```
This line calls the `hop()` method on the Jeroo named `jessica`, making it move forward one space. Methods encapsulate behavior and can be reused, reducing redundancy in code.

### **Creating New Objects Using `new`**
To create an instance of a class, we use the `new` keyword:
```java
Jeroo jessica = new Jeroo(8);
```
This statement creates a new Jeroo named `jessica` with 8 flowers. Java automatically calls a constructor when an object is instantiated. 

### **Inheritance: Superclass, Subclass, and `extends`**
Inheritance allows a class to derive properties and methods from another class. The `extends` keyword signifies that a class inherits from another:
```java
public class CustomJeroo extends Jeroo {
    // New methods or overrides can be added here
}
```
- **Superclass**: The base class (e.g., `Jeroo`) that provides methods and attributes.
- **Subclass**: The derived class (e.g., `CustomJeroo`) that inherits the superclass’s attributes and methods but can also introduce new ones or modify existing ones.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways. If `CustomJeroo` overrides a method from `Jeroo`, it can change how that method behaves.

### **Writing Methods and Method Stubs**
A method stub is a placeholder for a method that will be fully implemented later. It ensures the program compiles and can be gradually built out. For example:
```java
public void hopAndPlant() {
    // Method stub - to be implemented
}
```
A complete method example that extends Jeroo’s functionality:
```java
public void hopAndPlant() {
    this.hop();
    this.plant();
}
```
Here, the method makes a Jeroo hop forward and plant a flower in the new location.

### **Jeroo Methods (Core 7 Methods)**
Jeroos understand the following core methods:
- `hop()`: Moves forward one space.
- `hop(n)`: Moves forward `n` spaces.
- `pick()`: Picks up a flower at the current location.
- `plant()`: Plants a flower at the current location.
- `toss()`: Throws a flower forward, disabling a net.
- `turn(direction)`: Turns left or right.
- `give(direction)`: Gives a flower to another Jeroo in a specific direction.

Example usage:
```java
jessica.hop(3);
jessica.pick();
jessica.turn(LEFT);
```
This code moves `jessica` forward three spaces, picks up a flower, and turns left.

### **Creating Smarter Jeroos with Subclasses**
We can define a subclass of Jeroo to add new behaviors:
```java
public class SmartJeroo extends Jeroo {
    public void hopAndPlant() {
        this.hop();
        this.plant();
    }
}
```
Now, `SmartJeroo` objects can use `hopAndPlant()` in addition to the standard Jeroo methods.

### **Class Hierarchy and Inheritance**
Java organizes classes into a hierarchy. The `Object` class is at the top, and all other classes derive from it. 

Example hierarchy:
- `Object`
  - `Island`
  - `Jeroo`
    - `SmartJeroo`

A subclass can override methods to provide specialized behavior while still inheriting existing functionality.

### **Polymorphism in Jeroos**
Polymorphism allows different Jeroo subclasses to respond to the same method call in unique ways. A method like `hopAndPlant()` might be overridden in a subclass to alter its behavior, demonstrating polymorphism in action.

### **Summary**
- Objects are instances of classes.
- Methods define object behavior and can be called using dot notation.
- `new` creates objects and calls constructors.
- Inheritance (`extends`) allows subclasses to inherit from superclasses.
- Jeroos have core methods (`hop()`, `pick()`, etc.), and subclasses can introduce new behaviors.
- Polymorphism enables different subclasses to redefine inherited methods.

By leveraging inheritance and polymorphism, we can create more advanced Jeroos and efficiently organize object behaviors in Java.
