# Office Hours

**Location:** Torg 1070

**Schedule:** MTWRF 10am-6pm

There will be at least one TA in the room during these times. There may be multiple TAs during a given time period. TAs will have tent cards with the name of the course they are helping with to help you identify them.

If a TA is unable to make their office hours, they will attempt to get coverage to prevent a gap in help times. However, check Piazza for notes on office hours that may not be happening due to illness, travel, etc.

TAs will be on MyDigitalHand while they are holding office hours. You must fill out a help ticket in MyDigitalHand to receive help from a TA or instructor. This will also let you see how many TAs are holding hours and who they are (they should have a profile picture in MDH).

Be sure you enroll in the **Spring 25 section of CS 1114: Introduction to Software Design** with McPherson, Emebo, and Nizamani as instructors.

If you are coming to one of the instructor's office hours which are held in a different location, please indicate that in your help ticket so that the TAs in Torg 1070 do not try to pull you out of the queue there.
