# Neuroanatomical and Neuro-Rhythmic Differences in Individuals with Homocidal Behavior 

--- 

## Project 
- I want to do my paper on the neuroantomical differences and neurorhythmic difference that could be found in individuals exhibiting homocidal tendencies, thoughts, or actions when compared to a control group. 

---

## Outline 

### Introduction 
- Background of study and overview of the relevance of studying brain structure and function in relation to homocidal behavior. 
- A short oveview of violent vs nonviolent tendencies and behavior, and individuals and their relation to homocide. 
- A expedition on specific neuroantomical regions associated with aggression and an investigation of neurorhtymic patterns linked to impulsivity, aggression and violence. 
  
### Lit Review
- Summary of brain study from fMRI, MRI, and PET studies on aggressive vs non aggressive individuals. 
- Overview of existing research on neurorhythmic patterns and behaviors. 
  
### findings 
- idenficiation of neurorhthmic patterns and neuroanatomical changes in aggressive behavior. 
- Possible biomarkers identified

### discussion
- comparision of neuroanatomic and neurorhythmic fidings. 
- Clinical implications
- Limiations
- Future research

### conclusion
- Summary of findings and recap significance and implications. 
  
### References
- A list of references i will use.
