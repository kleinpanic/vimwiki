-- No journal 

## Wednesday 

### Part one: What piece of your creative writing are you thinkin of bringing for workshop? WHy did you choose this piece? What revisions or changes do you plan on making before bringing it to workshop? 

- The most recent piece i've written, my creative nonfiction piece. I chose this piece because I think I am the most proud of this piece so far in the process of this class. I hope and plan to revice the document, make it more meaningful, make sure every word that is written has a meaning, not necessarily more conscice or more complex, just that everything i've said actually contributes to the story.
