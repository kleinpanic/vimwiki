### I Remember Prompt: 

I remember traveling to las vegas to see the grateful dead. I stayed in the Venician. I remember walking through the cassino floors, cigerrete smoke filled the air. The sound of slot machines spinning, the busseling movement of hundres. It was over stimulating. I remmeber thinking "what a sight of human indulgence", but regardless, I did marvel at the magestic nature of the cassino floors, the sheer amount of tables, slot machines, and more. It was a labrynth of degeneracy. 

### The Five R's of Creative Nonfiction - 1. Which of the 5 Rs do you find the most challanging to incorporate into your own writing and why? 2. Choose an example from a creative non-fiction piece you've read or written. How does the piece demonstrate one or more of the 5 R's in practice?

1. Reflection. It is easy to recount events, research facts, and craft a well structured narrative, deep instrospection, and unpacking the meaning of experiences and connecting them to a larger theme, requires a level of vulnerability, patience, and self-understanding that is hard to find and often uncomfortable. 
   
2. "Fourth state of matter" By Jo Ann Beard is one of the best examples of creative nonfictions that I have read. The piece recounts the 1991 mass shooting at the University of Iowa, weaving personal grief, mundane life details, and the horror of the experience. It demonstrates Reflection, Research, and Real life events.

### I Remember Prompt: 

I remember the way my house in blacksburg smelled when I first entered it. I remember walking around it and seeing the first floor. It was a pretty nice house. It was old, but it is pretty large. The house would become a place I would call my home for the next 2 years until this current day and I have signed for next year. I remember first going into the basement, seeing the bar we have, seeing the lounge we have. It's a very nice house to live in while at college. 

### Cornerstone Images - think about your life and the images that linger with you, especially those that you don't understand. Then put together as many of these cornerstone images as you can. Then work to pair them up with oter cornerstone images or new images. Use these pairings to start a new work of creative nonfiction. Write 1-2 paragraphs and see if this is something you may want to continue. 

The flickering fluorescent light in the hallway of the hospital is a constant, its cold glow reflecting off the linoleum floor. I've seen it cast its pale light on everything - patients gasping through the weight of their last breaths, surgeons with stead hands inside of the skulls of he unconscious, nurses moving like quiet metronomes through the dimmed, yet piercing fluorescent light. Death, when it comes, is never cinematic. It doesn't announce itself with alarms and dramtic flatlines. It's quiet, almost indifferent. One moment there is a steady monitor beep reminding you there is still life, and the next silence. The silence after, is its own kind of sound. 
I think of the cold, white, sterile operating room. I remember the sound of the drill piercing skull bone, the smell of the bone dust, the veins and tissues, and thin layer of tisue beneath the bone. The tissue beneath, the brain matter, pulsates, breathes, in sync with the heartbeat of the patient, reminding you that inside, truly all is connected.
