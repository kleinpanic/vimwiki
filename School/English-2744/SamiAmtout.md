# Observatory Village 

* Sectioning by seasons is effective, but repetitive.
    * The “I remember” structure is used almost uniformly throughout the piece. While it captures a nostalgic tone, it eventually loses impact and rhythm.
* Some memories are rich in detail while others are sparse or underdeveloped.
* Jumps between moments can be jarring.
    * Transitions between memories sometimes lack connective tissue, which creates a fragmented narrative.
* Consider trimming weaker “I remember” entries to focus on the most emotionally resonant ones. For example, “I remember being able to wear shorts again” could be integrated into a richer spring anecdote.

## Sensory:

* Some scenes lack depth of description. 
    * The visual and emotional potential of settings like the observatory, ditches, and snowy days is sometimes underused.
* Too much telling over showing. For example, the phrase “We swam in a galaxy” is striking but isn’t expanded upon.

* Expand key sensory details:
  * What did the cold water of the sun-fountain feel like in contrast to the summer heat?
  * What were the smells, sounds, and textures at the winter dinner table?

## Condensings:

* Remove redundant seasonal statements. “I remember when the leaves started to turn…” and “I remember when the leaves started to fall…” could be merged or tightened.

## Reflection:

* While rich in anecdote, there’s a missed opportunity for internal reflection. How did these moments shape the narrator’s understanding of growth, family, or self?
* Closing repetition feels unfinished. “I remember always foolishly saying I wanted to grow up” echoes the beginning but doesn’t show how or if that wish changed.
