### I Remember prompt 

I remember driving to virginia tech for the first time. I did it with both of my parents. I was excited to get down here. I remember wondering what my dorm would be like, what my roommates would be like. I remember wondering how I would enjoy my classes, and my life here. The drive took forever, I remember all of the stops we made to use the bathroom, get gas, stretch our legs. It's funny in retrospect since now I make this drive by myself regularly, and I normally only make 1 stop halfway to fillup gas. 

> I was not here for this class but I think this is everything required.

## Friday 3/21 

### I remember prompt 

I remember going to silver dollar city with my older brother cole. He is significantly older then me and at this time he was a teen and me much younger I believe around 7. He went on rides I was too small for, and he seemed like the coolest guy in the world to me. I wanted to know him better, as he was only my half sibling and I didn't see him to often, but due to our ages, he was more annoyed by me than anything, and I can't blame him for that I was pretty annoying as a kid. 
I remember the funnel cake I would get there. I remember their special spiral potatos. I miss that place. I miss my younger years. I wish I knew how much these times would mean eventually.
