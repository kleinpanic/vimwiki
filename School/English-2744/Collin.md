## Notes on myself

- Braids: being in the operating room. Neuroscience and Ontology.
- Experiment with another braid - bring concrete self closer to essay.
    - Operating Scene: Not much is known about speaker (me). What do I myself believe? - the purpose was to envoke these questions.
- Imagery itself is decent. Add more emotional context for myself? Relate to the patient itself?
- Tendencies to repeat in some areas? - idk where yet. "Calmly, Meticulously, ..." - Make it dynamic? Have it go somewhere new each time? Slightly different images in the operating room.
- Vocabulary is too complex for an outside reader w/ very little prior knowledge. 
- Break up - include personal perspective or patient perspective. What is awarenes for this patient? What sensations and expeirences define their existence?
- Paragraph 4 - Elaborate more on the expereince of the patient. Its not well understead if its worded for me, or the patient. 
- I would like to make it as true to the actual experience as possible.
- Can feel semantic - By using own personal experience, and by adding potential for patient experience, it adds importance or gives it a purpose.
    - Include own experiences. 
- "It feels like i was writing to two seperate audiences. The general population and a specialist." - Choose a frame, definiently the specialist.
    - Neuroscience teaches stuff. Perhaps the explanations are too similar. She didn't give me that great of an example, ngl. I was talking about neuroplasticity lmfao.
    - Do not appease to two audiences. Neuroscience teaches us on identity shit - with several points similar. Have this type of sentence as a background / personification then expand on explanation? Not even for the neuro, too much for non neuro.
- Remove passive language - which can be inheriently medical so use that method sparingly. 

## The good 

- Some lines combine good personal experience and the operating room itself.

## The ending: 

- What is the purpose? I was trying to get people to ask themselves a question and make them uncomfortable with existence. 
- The ending question seems to be a question I already know an answer to. It seems i already argue that we are not physical beings, there is something already profound then physyicality. Ask a new question that jumps off of this. What new question could be asked? What makes you curious after writing or reading this. What are the existential and the implication in tangible reality?  What does this mean for the people at the end of their lives.
