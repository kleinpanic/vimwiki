## 1. Night in the Hollow Dark 

The wind hums low in the hollow dark,
a breathless hugh, a silver spark.
Moonlight spills through tangled boughs,
dripping cold on silent vows.

A fox slipped through the whispering ryse,
amber eyes like sparks that fly. 
The earth exhales in slumber deep,
where roots curl tight and crickets weep.

you hold the old world's ache -
a shadow tide, a ghosted wake. 
Your pulse is stiched with quiet things:
the hugh of wings,
the dream that sings. 

## 2. Midnight in the Kitchen 

The fridge hums at 2 in the morning. 
It casts it neon light on 
chrome reflections. 

I brush crumbs from the counter 
ghosts of dinner, lingering
after laughter and half-truths
cooled in the evening air. 

My fingers trace the countertop
still cold as the gap between 
words never met. 
Tonight, I crave only silence:
the hum, the crumb,
the quiet solitude. 

## 3. Mirror in the Attic 

The attic swells with dust and half-light;
floorboard sigh with each cautious step. 
A draped mirror stands, waiting - 
its secrets hidden by cotten veil. 

I lift the cloth and see my face, 
older now, carrying echoes
of what I might have been.
In that glass, a younger gaze flickers:
untaed delight, a grin unbothered 
by time's gentle erosion. 

The moment passes like a breath.
I replace the covering, 
and the dust settles again
as if to hold my memories still
in the hush of an undistrurbed attic. 

## 4. The Weight of Remembering 

I wash the dishes,
hands steeped in water so hot
it prickles the edges of my skin. 
Steam rises like breath, like fog;
plates clatter a shade too loud - 
an unintentional shatter.

Outside, a car door slams.
For a moment, I think it's you. 
The house holds its breath,
then exhales nothing.

I wipe the counter clean,
listening to the faucet's drip -
a slow, broken metronome.
Your favorite mug waits in a drawer,
its handle grasping at emptiness. 
I can't bear to throw it away. 
This is how I remember you now:
a silent object
 that weights more then it should. 

## 5. New Horizons

Morning spills through the blinds,
unrelenting in its brightness.
You asked how we continue
when your story trails off 
in incomplete paragraphs.

But like birds forging new paths,
we search opn skies,
horizons widen as soon 
as we dare to lift our wings.
Memory rustles in the margins,
never fully erased,
yet a quieter presence
amid the day's fresh light.

Each dawn suggests a chapter
untethered to what was lost.
Half-told tales can still 
guide us forward, and 
hope greets us in the golden spill
of another sunrise.
