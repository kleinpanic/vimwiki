I Remember traveling to Peurta Rico a few weeks ago. I went with a good friend of mine Jacob. 
We flew out to PR with no real plan. We didn't have any hotels or any means of living or traveling. 
We rented out a card and traveled the island. We went to San juan. We drove to the rain forest. we went to Dorado, We went to Seven Seas. we got to see the PR festival.
