## Choosing your Braids. Chosen Neuroscience. 

I arrived at the hospital. A nurse meets me and takes me to the back and instructs me to change into disposable surgical equipment. "Here are the pants, here are the shirts, and here is the head and shoe covering" he said to me as he pointed to individual boxes. After I had changed, he led me to heavy metal doors. I walked through, and was told to clean my hand thoroughly. In the sterile brightness of the operating room, consciousness pulses gently beneath my gaze. The surgeon makes a precise incision on the patient’s temple. A tool, resembling a paint scraper, separates skin from skull, the fibers beneath resisting like Velcro being torn apart. The surgeon’s hand moves steadily, confidently. Beneath his fingers lies a universe of neurons, hidden for now by bone. The drill whirrs, a sharp mechanical cry echoing through sterile silence. Dust blooms, and with it, a smell permeates the room—formaldehyde mingled with something primal, unsettling. I remember this smell most vividly, imprinting itself on my memory as the surgeon penetrates the skull’s parietal section. The bone yields, opening like a fragile lid over the delicate interior. Greyish-white dura mater envelopes the darker, pulsing mass beneath—the brain itself. It moves rhythmically, steady, like a quiet heartbeat. Blood vessels stretch across its surface, an intricate network more complex than any human highway system. Beneath this complex vascular web is a clear and undeniable pathology—a large, pale meningioma the size of two golf balls pressed insistently against the delicate tissue, tethered stubbornly to the dura. The patient’s brain pulses visibly, vulnerable and exposed. Inside that pulsating tissue, housed within billions of interconnected neurons quietly firing, exists an entire identity—dreams, memories, fears, and motivations—encoded in cells communicating in a silent, ongoing symphony we recognize as consciousness.

Ontology defines a being as the fundamental essence of existence, categorizing reality into neat divisions, mainly particulars and universals, concrete and abstracts. particulars are singulars, irreplaceable entities, like the patient on the table, her life tangible, irreplaceable. Universals are broader, shared repeatedly qualities like the concept of health, pain, identity, or even consciousness itself. Yet ontology itself falters when we stand in the operating room, witnessing a consciousness laid bare, laid to rest, but not permanently. Where does consciousness fall between particular and universal? Is it concrete? Is it abstract? These distinctions blur beneath the stark fluorescent lights illuminating human vulnerability in all of its essence both physically and consciously.

Neuroscience attempts to unravel the intricate relationship between the physical organ - the brain - and the intangible experience we call thought, emotion, identity, and experience. In the operating room, I was witnessing neuroscience;s questions enacted in stark, uncompromising detail. How does a physical anomaly, a tumor pressed against the soft delicate tissue of the neural tissue, alter the intangible realms of personality, memory, experience, and self-awareness? Neuroscientists understand consciousness as emerging from neuronal interactions. Electrical signals firing in rhythmic patterns produce what we experience as thought and experience. Electrochemical pulses send neurotransmitters to communicate at astonishing speeds, leaping synaptic gaps, communicating information. But science’s meticulous detail still struggles with the mystery of subjective experience. How do these tangible interactions yield intangible thought?

The neurosurgeon is calm. He is playing heavy metal on a speaker in the operating room, while he is operating on her brain. The surgeon tells me to come closer. He directs me to look into the cavity of her skull, and he asks me to identify anatomical regions being dissected and navigated through. This open brain, pulsating, softly, now manipulated to have shown the tumor in its full glory for easy extraction. The surgeon asks for the cauterizer. He begins to detach the tumor, the tissue being touched by the tool becomes burnt and separated. The sound of burning tissue sizzles in the room. Smoke emanates from the tissue, an acrid smell drifts upwards, and it fills the room.

Ontology classifies reality into substances, properties, relations, and states of affairs. Substance is the brain itself, concrete and tangible. Properties are its grey-pink gue, its soft texture. Relations are formed by the neurons linking and communicating, creating states of affairs such as consciousness or awareness of self. But standing there, the limitations of those categories become apparent. They fail to explain how subjective experience arises from mere physical matter. Consciousness does not fit into ontology’s tidy classifications. It resists definitions, and encapsulation, spilling over boundaries set by philosophers attempting to catalog existence. Consciousness transcends the clear lines we’ve drawn between matter and thought, between biology and identity.

My experience of the meningioma removal is not my only surgical experience. THe spinal surgery I viewed and shadowed offered yet another glimpse into physicality’s intersection with consciousness. I walked into another operating room, with a new neurosurgeon present. In contrast to the other surgery, this one had many more medical personnel. In addition to the medical personnel, there was a miscellaneous individual from a medical development company that was testing out their new product to measure electrical potential throughout the body.

Another patient lay face-down, anesthetized and vulnerable. The surgeon sliced into their spin, meticulously exposing the vertebrae of the patient. He went on to clean the bones from all ligaments, epithelial cells, and fibers. It was clearly visible and distinctly white. The surgeon removed the damaged bone with a metallic drill. He cleanly removed damaged ligaments, all to remove a stenosis, a narrowing compressing nerves causing pain.

His spine layed exposed, stark bone gleamed under the surgical lights. Electrodes, needle like, threaded into every muscle, and nerve, all throughout the body, measuring the electrical potential of the body. I remember thinking "the patient looks like a porcupine". I remember thinking too, that these needles aim to represent, and map the complex system of nerves. 
This network of nerves, intricately branched from the spinal cord, carries signals vital for sensation, movement, and perception. Seeing this living map of nerves, sensing the fragility of it all, it highlighted the interplay between structure and experience. Damaged vertebrae had disrupted signals, it created pain and loss of function in the patient’s left leg. neuroscience has shown us precisely how these physical changes alteres experiences like pain, sensation, and movement. Understanding the neural pathways offered some comfort but not much when comprehending the subjective agony experienced by the patient prior to the operation.

Ontology searches endedless for the precise boundary between mind and matter. The spinal surgery, and the craniotomy, blurred these distinctions, causing me to doubt my understanding of meaning. If identity and consciousness rely critically on the physical integrity of neurons and nerves,is consciousness biological or does it exist independently as ontology’s “abstract objects”, intangible and eternal, only temporarily housed in tissue?
Does consciousness end with the death of the cells of the brain? Is that just the beginning of experience? Is experience more then just the neurochemical and neuroelectrical communications of the brain or is it more? Ontology aims to answer these questions, but it is not a solid science. Neuroscience too aim's to answer these questions, but its answers are in-concrete.

The neurosurgeon for the craniotomy’s hands moved with precision. The tumor had been freed, and now rested in a sterile container. He told me that he was going to send it to pathology for identification. He carefully inspected the operation, ensuring all the cancerous cells were removed. They packed the open space with surgical compression tissue. He sealed the dura mater. He put a tube into the space, and covered the hole left in the skull with a metal plate, leaving the tube out. He temporarily stored the skin close, leaving the tube for drainage over the next couple days. The pulsating consciousness beneath it all resumes its hidden operations, invisible once more beneath the skin, and artificial bone, to be replaced by the real bone in a few days.

The patient was taken away to recover in the ICU. Neurologists later came and tested her memory, her motor function, her speech. The surgery was successful, her consciousness and self was intact, now free from the tumor's pressure.
The question still lingered however, if removing the tumor had changed something fundamental within her? How intimately is identity tied to the physical brain, if a physical change can be so profound, but not impact the intangible?

Neuroscience teaches us that identity is indeed fragile, a delicate symphony played upon the neural circuits of the brain. Ontology reminds us that identity transcends mere physicality existing also in the intangible realm of ideas, concepts and self-awareness. Standing in the operating room, I had witnessed firsthand the intricate delicate structure housing a patient’s consciousness, reminding me that understanding consciousness demands embracing ambiguity. Consciousness is at once physical and abstract, universal and particular, concrete and immeasurably elusive.

After the surgery I left the operating room. The smell stuck to my surgical attire. It reminded me how tightly physicalities bind to the conscious. The operating room's sterile lights fade away but the experience stays with me. Are we merely physical beings, neurons firing in rhythmic harmony, or is experience, consciousness, and being more profound? The answer will remain elusive, pulsing gently beneath the skill, concealed in bone, and sheathed in the meninges.
