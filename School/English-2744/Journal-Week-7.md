## Part 1: I remember prompt 

I Remember building my fblogin page for debian systems. I remember having to initialize the frame buffer, having to figure out how to draw containers on the frame buffer, figuring out raw input on the kernel level, figuring out how to trap signal calls that might interfere with the program's operation and intention. For instance I had to trap EOT, and having to trap SIGINT. 

## Part 2: What do you know about lyric poetry? 

Absolutely nothing. 

## Homework - Draft a lyric poem. 

The wind hums low in the hollow dark, 
a breathless hush, a silver spark.
Moonlight spills through tangled boughs,
dripping cold on silent vows.
A fox slips thin through the whispering ryse,
Amber eyes like sparks that fly. 
The earth exhales in slumber deep,
Where roots curl tight and crickets weep. 
Oh, night, you hold the old worlds ache - a shadow tide,
A  ghosted wake. 
Your pulse is switched with quiet things,
the hush of wings,
the dream that sings.

## Part 1: I remember journal. 

I remember waking up as a child to a random snow day. I remember I was excited - I didn't have school. I ran downstairs to great my parents. When i was younger the world seemed much brighter to me. I got into my snow gear. I went outside on the front porch with my mother, waddling thru the snow. I remember getting on the balcony of the deck. The snow was so high so I decided to jump off. The snow cushioned my fall. I remember getting back up. This was when my brother still lived with us, and he was a teenager. We together built an igloo with the snowfall. It was a good memory. 

## Part two: What piece of art made you feel or think of grief or sadness? It can be artwork, a film, a song, a book/story, or something else. Explain why.

The Ile of the Dead by Arnold Bocklin, particularly the third version. The painting depicts a lone. shrouded fgigure standing in a small boat, being rowed towards a dark, rocky island filled with towering cypress trees, which I just recently learned are symbols of mourning. The water is still, and the silence in the patining speaks overwhelmingly. The scene carries the weight of finality. It is a depiction of the space between life and death, the solumn moment of passage when someone departs, bever to return. The paitning only tells a part of a story, but the short story it depicts is haunting. The rooms of the mountains on the island beckon to the character on the boat, to us, as one day, we all shall be that character, on the boat, being brought to the inescapable pull of death.
