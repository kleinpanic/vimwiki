## I remeber Prompt 

I Remember traveling to france. I left middle school early. The flight was not very long suprisngly, or at least I don't remember it being very long. When we landed we landed in paris. I remember walking through paris with my suitcase. I remember being very underwealmeed by Paris. I did find all of it's architecture and landmarks beauitful however it seemed like a French version of New York City. I later was able to travel to Versace, which was insanely beauitful, and breathtaking. There was no American comparison to the castle and its beauity. I remember traveling through the gardens of Versace and havign an amazing time there, while learning quite a lot about old french royalty.

Traveling through the dark I found a deer dead on the edge of the Wilson River road. / It is usually best to roll them into the canyon: / that road is
narrow; to swerve might make more dead. / By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing; she had
stiffened already, almost cold. / I dragged her off; she was large in the belly. My fingers touching her side brought me the reason—her side was warm; / 
her fawn lay there waiting, alive, still, never to be born. Beside that mountain road I hesitated. / The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights; under
the hood purred the steady engine. / I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red; around our group I could hear the wilderness listen. I
thought hard for us all—my only swerving—, / then pushed her over the edge into the river.

## I remember Prompt: 

I remember traveling to Canada in my youth. I would go every year when I was younger. My mother's side of the family owned Cabin's in Canada. We would travel over the boarder, and drive into Canada. We would find ourselves at a lakehouse eventually. It had 4 cabins. My mother and I got a cabin, my cousin's and aunts got their own as well. We would go fishing eveyday, there were boats that were offered to us. Additionally there was a lake cove about a mile walk away where we would go swimming everyday. 

## Persona Poetry: 
- I will be selecting Migrant Mother, captured in 1936, by Dorthea Lange, duing the great depression. 

- Poetry: 
"In the dust's relentless grip, I stand alone, Children clinging, seeking comfort's hand. Lines etch stories of hung'ers embrace, eyes cast forward, devoid of light.
Fields once fertile, now lay barren, dry, dreams of plenty have withered and died.
Yet within, a flicker, a stubborn, bright, hope, defying the darkness. 
Through hardship;s weight, I bear the strain, A mother's love amidst the pain. For in their eyes, future gleams, beyond the dust, beyond the dark."
