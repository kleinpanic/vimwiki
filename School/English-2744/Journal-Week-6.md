## Journal 11:15-11:20
Part one: Take 5 minutes now to complete your I remember prompt in your journal 

I remember waking up one Wednesday, feeling sick. My nose was running profusely, it was incredibly itchy. I had a persistent and annoying cough. 
I remember feeling like I should not attend classes. I decided I should take pseudoephredrine and I called my mother who is a accupunturist. She gave me recommendations of chinese medicine to take. I took that as well. I got into a warm shower to clear my nose, and it worked for the most part. 


## Sonnet Writing - Write a sonnet.  
- Questions to ask before you begin:
- [ ] How strong do you want to "play" the form?
- [ ] What is the question/conflict/answeable charge, and how will it be resolved? 
- [ ] Will your poem's subject meet or defy the thematic expectations of sonnets (re: love)?

The Edge of Winter: 
The brittle air is laced with dying leaves, 
Each breath a ghost that curls and drifts away. 
The trees stand bare, like men whom time bereaves,
their hnds once full, now trembling in decay. 
I walk the path where autumn used to burn,
It's embers lost beneath a coat of frost. 
I swore that lvoe would find a way, return,
But love, like seasons, learns what must be lost. 
And yet, beneath the ice, the roots remain, 
a whispered promise buried out of sight. 
Though winter;s hand may carve the earth with pain,
the buds still wait beneath the silent white. 
So let the cold take all its claims to own- 
Spring wakes in places only sorrow's known.

## Journal 11:15-11:20
I remember prompt: 
- I remember 3 weeks ago when I first came to class and first had to do my i remember prompt. Ironically enough I do not remmeber what my i remmeber prompt was initially about. I remember sitting here and kind of trying to think of what to say. I remember sitting in this exact same spot and introducing myself to the man on my left. We talked about coding for a bit. I finished my prompt and the class continued.

Dear Wanderer, 
I regret to inform you that the world you sought does not exist. 
You were ight to look for it. In the orange hush of morning, when the river held the sky in its throat and the wind moved like a whispered secret through the trees, you must have thought you were close. When the road bent in ways that felt designed for you, when the fog lifted just enough to reveal a house yo uswore you had seen a dream - how could you not beleive? 
But beliefe is a fragile thing. It cracks under too much light. You searched in libraries, traced your fingers over maps yellowed with dust, followed the footsteps of those who claimed they had seen its gates. You read the stories, the letters, the fragments left behind. A place where the moon drips silver over quiet streets, where doorways open to laughter and hands know how to hold without hurting. A place where time does not slip through the cracks of your grasp.
I regret to inform you that no cartographer has charted this land, no read will take yo uthere. 
And yet, I have seen you stand beneat hthe aching ksy, watching the last embr of the sun sink into the hills. I have seen the way you breathe in the dark and know that somewhere, soemthing waits. 
So go.
keep walking. 
There are places the maps have missed.
Sincerely,
The road ahead.

## I remember: 
I remember joining my fraternity. I remember first rushing the fraternity, meeting all of the dudes, having a good time. I eventually got a bid. I remember them texting me, and their chant. I remember going outside of my dorm to go accept it. I remember accepting my bid thru IFC. I remember over time being initiated into the fraternity. Over time I ran for risk manager, and won. After that I ran for vice presidency and won, and now I have ran for presidency and won.
