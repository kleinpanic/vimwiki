## Journal 11:15-11:20
Part one: Take 5 minutes now to complete your I remember prompt in your journal 

I remember waking up one Wednesday, feeling sick. My nose was running profusely, it was incredibly itchy. I had a persistent and annoying cough. 
I remember feeling like I should not attend classes. I decided I should take pseudoephredrine and I called my mother who is a accupunturist. She gave me recommendations of chinese medicine to take. I took that as well. I got into a warm shower to clear my nose, and it worked for the most part. 


## Sonnet Writing - Write a sonnet.  
- Questions to ask before you begin:

- [ ] What is the question/conflict/answeable charge, and how will it be resolves? 
- [ ] Will your poem's subject meet or defy the thematic expectations of sonnets (re: love)?
