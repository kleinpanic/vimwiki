# Asynchronous Assignment:

## Response to "Miss you, would like to talk a walk with you."

1. Line that stands out: 
   "Miss you. Wish you would walk through my door."
This resonates wth me because its a simple line, but has a yearning tone. The repetition of "Miss you" followed by the desire to walk with someone who is no longer here feels human and shows the grief of the indiviudal. 

2. Playing with the form
Love to **see you**. Sit over **this old wooden bench
by the lake where we used to meet.
The sky looks the same, but you are missing.**
Miss you. Would love to walk to **the old bookstore** with you.
Bring the **stories you never got to finish**. We’ll walk past the **graffiti bridge**
and you can tell me about **your distain for the art**.
Wish you. Wish you would **just answer one last time.**
Don’t even need to bring your **voice**. I’ll know
you. I know you will know me even though. I’m
**older** now. **I Miss You**

## Response to "Michiko Dead" - Gilbert. 

1. Lines that stands out. 
   
   "He manages like somebody carrying a box   
    that is too heavy, first with his arms
    underneath."

This stands out due to the strong imeragy used. It makes grief tangible. It isn't an abstract emotional state, but rather it gives a physical sensation to the expeirence of grief - the expeirence of hauling a casket. It transforms the loss of someone into the physical weight that is hard to carry, doesn't settle right, and always threatens to slip out of your control. 

2. Action & Grief Writing:

I wash the dishes,
Hot water scalds my hands.
I don't move them away from the flame.
The steam rises like breath, like fog, 
The plates clatter a bit too loudly, 
Like breaking something I didn't mean to. 
Outside, a car door slams. 
For a brief moment, 
I think it's you...

## Final Task - Expanding Poem

**The Weight of Remembering**

I wash the dishes,
Hot water scalds my hands.
I don't move them away from the flame.
The steam rises like breath, like fog, 
The plates clatter a bit too loudly, 
Like breaking something I didn't mean to. 
Outside, a car door slams. 
For a brief moment, 
I think it's you...

But the silence after is thick,
The house door never opens after. 
I wipe the counter, 
The faucet drips, like a slow broken metronome. 
Somewhere, in a drawer, lies your favorite mug. 
I have no purpose for it now but
I cannot throw it away
