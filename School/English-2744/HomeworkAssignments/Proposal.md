# Proposal 

My story centers on Mirren, a determined young women in a secluded village known as Meadowvale, and her younger brother Milo, who as born / plucked from a tree in the village's "Mysterious" orchard. Farley, the caretaker of the orchard, will also play a key role in the story. They are torn between protecting an ancient secret and acknowledges the potential harm that this secret causes. 
Mirren's quest to understand the orchard pits her against Meadowvale's deeply rooted traditions. The entire village depends on te orchard for its "miracle fruit", which not only yields actual pears but also produces living children thru its fruit. Farley and the elders uphold a centuries-old agreeance of silence to preserve these gifts. By uncovering the truth, Mirren risks bringing down the orchard's curse - or losing it altogether. This will be the external conflict 

The internal conflict will be Mirren's struggle with her sense of loyalty and guilt - her mother's dying words will hitn that secrecy might be harming her loved ones. She fears that if she remains silent, Milo's life could be in danger. This leads her to question whether it is more important to protect tradition or to expose the secrecy of the orchards to save her siblng. 

The story will take place in Meadowvale, a small, self-sufficient and isolated village nested in a valley by hills. At the heart of the village is the ancient orchard, rumored to have existed as long as the village itself. There are secrets about this orchard. It is rumored to have existed as long as the village itself. The orchard's gnarled towering pear trees are the source of both human life and fruit. 

I plan to use third-person limited to focus on Mirren's perspecive. This POV allows readers to experience her growing unease, curiosity, and determination firsthand.
