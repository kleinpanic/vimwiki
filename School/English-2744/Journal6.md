## I remember prompt 
I remember last year on MLK day me and a few of my frat brothers we all went to Snowshoe. It was the largest snowfall i've ever experienced in blacksburg, it was truly intense. We drove there, it took us 4 hours to get to the mountain. The mountain conditions were impeccible. There were very few people there, largely due to the intense weather, but me and my boys had a blast. We road for hours. We got there at like 9 am, we skiied til like 5pm. When we had to go back, the conditions on the road were horrendous. It took like twice as long, and at one point we were going sideways down the highway.
