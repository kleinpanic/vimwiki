# Ethics in Science: Data Acquisition and Reporting

---

## Question 1

- Prompt: 
    - If Millikan had not written in his 1913 paper that “this is not a select group of drops but represents all of the drops experimented upon” would his actions be considered blameworthy or at the very least questionable and why? Does your answer depend on whether you view the situation as his contemporary or an observer in the present? Your explanation should be between 75 and 150 words.

- Response:
    - If Millikan had not claimed that the data in his 1913 paper "represent all of the drops experimented upon" his actions would still be questionable, though he would be less blameworthy. His statement implied full transparency, suggesting that there was no data selection, when, in reality, he excluded certain drops he deemed as unreliable, which is not scientific. From an ethical perspective, this selective "cherry-picking" or data handling will mislead others by overstating the comprehensiveness of his findings, and implying false truths. Whitbeck's framework on trustworthiness emphasizes that honest reporting and transparency are paramount arguing that even slight minor deviations from full disclosure can undermine scientific trust, and the legitimacy of the entire study. In his day and age, standards for data selection were not fully developed but rather evolving, and as such Millikan's action were seemed less unethical in his times. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, in modern day, data integrity is paramount to all, and it is a standard to make sure integrity is rigorously upheld. As such, his omission of this information would be seen as a significant breach of honesty, and would undermine his entire scientific career and trust, resulting in a lack of confidence in his other commitments to the scientific community. Overall it would bring into question his commitment to ethical standards essential to scientific trust in this day and age.

## Question 2-4 Case Study.

- Prompt: 
  
    - You are working in a lab as an undergraduate researcher where data are accumulated for the purposes of measuring the optical absorption of a variety of samples. For each sample, there is a large data file stored on a computer in the lab. After reviewing a lab notebook from one of your predecessors and comparing the entries to the data published by the lab, you find a gap. That is, some of the data your predecessor published are not accounted for in the lab notebook. Furthermore, you are unable to locate the computer files for this missing data.

### Question 2: Missing Data

- Prompt: 
    - Describe a possible situation that accounts for the missing data but does not qualify as research misconduct. Explain using Whitbeck's framework.
Your explanation should be between 75 and 150 words.

- Response:
    - A plausible scenario for the missing data that would not constitute research misconduct could be a technical error or an accidental deletion of data. For instance, the computer storing the data might experience a system failure, memory overloads, or whatever the case may be, to cause data corruption or flat-out loss. Alternatively, the data could be misplaced due to an organizational error or accidental overwriting errors. Using whitbeck's framework, this situation could be seen as a lapse in procedural diligence rather than an ethical violation, as there was no clear intent to deceive or misrepresent the actual findings. Whitbeck emphasizes that not all lapses are misconduct; some like negligence in data handling are indications for improvement in lap practices rather than reflect an ethical failing. 

### Question 3: misconduct

- Prompt: 
  - Describe a possible situation that accounts for the missing data and qualifies as research misconduct but not outright fraud. Explain using Whitbeck's framework.Your explanation should be between 75 and 150 words.

- Response:
    - A situation involving research misconduct could be that the predecessor excluded certain data points that did not align well with the trends, aiming to make the results appear more consistent and line up better with their analysis. This is selective reporting, or cherry picking, and while it is not fabricating data, it misrepresents the research by omitting findings that may have been relevant to a  more complete understanding, and better reflecting the true nature of the situation. According to Whitbeck's framework, this action falls under "Reckless" or "negligent" conduct rather than outright fraud, as there is no direct falsification or fabrication of data, rather omitting it. By selecting omitting data the researcher is failing in their responsibility to accurately report findings and represent them, and thus undermining their trustworthiness. Whitbeck emphasizes that even when it's not intentional deception, actions compromising integrity of data presented are ethically problematic as they erode the trust that is required for reliable research. 

### Question 4: Ethical Principles: 

- Prompt:
    - Suppose you report the issue of the missing data to a graduate student in your research group. After discussing the matter for some time, the graduate student says, in a somewhat incensed tone, "I only have 6 weeks to finish my dissertation and I can’t deal with this right now. Regardless, we got the “right” result, so what difference does it make that some of the data is missing?” How should you respond? Your explanation should be between 100 and 200 words.

- Response:
    - I would acknowledge that they are pressured, and they are validated in this feeling. The pressure they feel, given their limited time to complete the dissertation is certainly a scary and daunting situation. That being said I would take the time to emphasize that scientific research depends on transparency and the integrity of data. I would further emphasize that the potential pay off is not worth the potential liability. If my friend were to be caught for what he is proposing, which to my understanding is fabrication of data points, would result is severe repercussion. They may lose their degree, they may be kicked out of school, they may be publicly discredited and never be able to work in their field again, and for what? Just to submit a dissertation on "time" that will most likely be caught for fabrication of data set, if not now, in the future? Trust in research relies not only on getting the "right" results but on the ethical presentation of the data that led to the conclusion. A lack of data sets is not unethical, and can be addressed in the dissertation itself, however, the fabrication of data is unethical and could has repercussions. Missing data would raise questions about the reliability of the entire study, but it would not put the author in an ethically problematic situation. I would suggest a practical approach, document the issuess thoroughly, note any explanations for the data gap. This documentation would be included in the dissertation for an account of the research process. I would tell him we have to upholdWhitbeck's Principles of trustworthiness and responsibility, and addressing these issues even briefly improves and ensures the integrity of the work, and it could prevent scrutinity or repercussion against him or my group.
