# Advanced Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT Models

## Overview of OpenAI ChatGPT Models

OpenAI provides several advanced **ChatGPT models** with distinct capabilities and internal designs. This article focuses on four key models often available via the ChatGPT web interface: **OpenAI o1**, **GPT-4**, **o3-mini**, and **o3-mini-high**. All of these are **large language models (LLMs)** built on the transformer architecture, but each has unique characteristics in terms of size, training approach, reasoning style, and use cases.

- **GPT-4 (ChatGPT GPT-4)** – The flagship model of the GPT series, known for its high parameter count (rumored at 1.76 trillion) and broad general knowledge ([GPT-4 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4#:~:text=Rumors%20claim%20that%20GPT,12)). GPT-4 excels at understanding nuanced instructions and is *multimodal*, accepting text and images as input in some versions ([GPT-4 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4#:~:text=before%20training%20it%2C%20although%20other,18)). It has very large context windows (8k tokens by default and up to 32k in extended versions) ([GPT-4 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4#:~:text=OpenAI%20stated%20that%20GPT,in%20unusual%20images%2C%20summarize%20text)), enabling it to handle lengthy conversations or documents. GPT-4 is more *reliable, creative, and nuanced* than earlier GPT-3.5 models ([GPT-4 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4#:~:text=)), and was trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for alignment. In the ChatGPT interface, GPT-4 (sometimes referred to as **GPT-4o** in OpenAI's documentation) is the general-purpose model recommended for most tasks. It introduced the **system message** concept to control tone and behavior ([GPT-4 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4#:~:text=To%20gain%20further%20control%20over,17)), and it supports advanced features like browsing, plug-ins, voice input, and vision on the ChatGPT platform.

- **OpenAI o1 (ChatGPT o1)** – The first of OpenAI’s *“reasoning”* series (O-series) models, unveiled as *o1-preview* in late 2024. OpenAI o1 is described as a **reflective GPT model**: it is trained to spend more time *“thinking”* (generating an internal chain-of-thought) before producing a final answer. This approach makes o1 particularly strong at *complex reasoning tasks* in domains like science, mathematics, and programming ([OpenAI o1 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_o1#:~:text=o1,preview.%5B%2017)). In benchmarks, o1-preview performed at roughly PhD level on physics, chemistry, and biology questions, solving 83% of International Math Olympiad qualifier problems (versus only 13% by GPT-4 on the same test) ([OpenAI o1 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_o1#:~:text=o1,preview.%5B%2017)). The full version of o1 was released to ChatGPT users on Dec 5, 2024, alongside a higher-powered **o1-pro** variant for ChatGPT Pro subscribers that uses more compute for even better answers. O1 has an enormous context window (up to 128k tokens via API, though limited to 32k in ChatGPT UI). Unlike GPT-4, which relies on sheer model size and knowledge, o1’s strength is *deliberative reasoning*: it generates longer hidden thought sequences and explores different solution paths internally. OpenAI emphasizes that o1 is a **complement** to GPT-4 rather than a successor – GPT-4 remains better for many common tasks, but o1 shines in complex, multi-step problems requiring deep reasoning.

- **OpenAI o3-mini** – A newer, smaller reasoning model released in early 2025 as part of the O-series. O3-mini is optimized for **speed and cost-efficiency** while still delivering strong reasoning performance, especially in STEM fields (science, math, coding). It effectively replaces the earlier o1-mini model, offering faster responses and higher accuracy at a lower latency and cost. Internally, o3-mini is a scaled-down model that can “think” through problems but with fewer parameters; developers can even configure its *reasoning effort* at three levels (low, medium, high) via the API. Notably, o3-mini introduced support for features like **function calling and structured outputs** that were missing in o1-preview, making it more *“production-ready”* for applications. In head-to-head evaluations, o3-mini at high reasoning depth can match or exceed o1’s accuracy on many tasks. For example, in coding benchmarks, o3-mini (with medium effort) surpassed o1-high’s performance, and at high effort it extended the lead with significantly stronger results. Testers have found that o3-mini often produces **clearer and more accurate answers** than o1-mini, with a 39% reduction in major errors on challenging questions. However, o3-mini does *not* support image inputs or visual tasks (it lacks the multimodal vision that GPT-4 has) ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=specific%20use%20cases,opens%20in%20a%20new%20window)). In ChatGPT’s model picker, Plus/Pro users can select o3-mini, including on the free tier (first time a reasoning model is available to free users, via a “Reason” mode). O3-mini is ideal when you need **fast, cost-effective reasoning** for coding and analytical tasks, while still achieving high accuracy.

- **OpenAI o3-mini-high** – This refers to using the o3-mini model at its **high reasoning setting** (as opposed to low or medium). At high reasoning mode, o3-mini devotes more computation and internal thought steps to a query, closer to how o1 operates. Practically, o3-mini-high is like a smaller model “thinking hard.” OpenAI notes that o3-mini at high effort *“matches o1’s accuracy”* on complex tasks. It can serve as a faster substitute for the full o1 model in many cases, albeit possibly with slightly less extensive world knowledge. In ChatGPT’s web interface, there isn’t a manual toggle for reasoning mode, but the system may automatically apply higher effort for complex queries. Users can also implicitly encourage deeper reasoning by the way they prompt (e.g. asking for detailed solutions). The key trade-off is that **o3-mini-high responses are slower** than default (low/medium) o3-mini because the model is allocating more time to deliberate. Still, o3-mini-high remains *faster than o1* in practice. It provides a sweet spot for users who want near o1-level problem-solving rigor with lower latency.

All these models are built on the **transformer architecture** and trained on vast corpora of text with **unsupervised pre-training** followed by **fine-tuning** (including RLHF for alignment). They differ in scale and specialized training objectives. GPT-4 follows the traditional GPT series scaling (extremely large model, broad capabilities), whereas the O-series (o1, o3-mini) introduces a new paradigm of *reflective reasoning*, where the model internally generates and evaluates thought chains. According to OpenAI’s CTO Mira Murati, this represents an additional paradigm to improve outputs by spending more compute per query, as opposed to only scaling model size. The result is that O-series models can outperform larger models on certain complex tasks by virtue of this intensive reasoning process.

## Internal Functioning and Differences

Understanding how these models function internally can help in crafting better prompts. Fundamentally, all are **large language models (LLMs)** that generate text by predicting the next token (word piece) given a prompt. They use the Transformer neural network architecture to process context and produce outputs. However, the models have internal differences in how they handle prompts and reasoning:

- **GPT-4’s Mechanism:** GPT-4 processes prompts in one pass to generate an answer, utilizing its massive training knowledge and capacity to interpret nuanced instructions ([GPT-4 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4#:~:text=OpenAI%20stated%20that%20GPT,in%20unusual%20images%2C%20summarize%20text)). It does not explicitly generate a separate chain-of-thought that is hidden; instead, any reasoning is implicit in the generated tokens unless the user requests an explanation. GPT-4 was trained on diverse data and with updated techniques (OpenAI has updated GPT-4 with new versions like *GPT-4 October 2023*, hence the term GPT-4o) which improved its problem-solving and coding abilities ([What's new in Azure OpenAI Service? - Learn Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/whats-new#:~:text=What%27s%20new%20in%20Azure%20OpenAI,and%20in%20vision%20tasks)). It also received knowledge updates beyond the original 2023 cutoff ([GPT-4o gets first ever knowledge update! All models thus ... - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1he812q/gpt4o_gets_first_ever_knowledge_update_all_models/#:~:text=Reddit%20www.reddit.com%20%20GPT,Discussion)), making it more up-to-date on facts as of early 2024. GPT-4 strictly follows a **system-user-assistant message paradigm** in ChatGPT ([GPT-4 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4#:~:text=To%20gain%20further%20control%20over,17)). The system message (set by OpenAI or custom instructions) strongly conditions its behavior and style, ensuring it stays within desired guidelines. GPT-4 is robust to user attempts to derail its style – for instance, if the system says to respond in JSON or as a Shakespearean pirate, it will consistently do so despite user prompts to deviate ([GPT-4 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4#:~:text=To%20gain%20further%20control%20over,17)). This rigidity makes GPT-4 reliable in format following. Internally, GPT-4 does not have the “thinking for long” mechanism that o1 has, but its sheer scale gives it strong reasoning abilities. It’s also heavily tuned to refuse disallowed content and follow guardrails, due to RLHF.

- **OpenAI o1’s Reflective Reasoning:** O1 introduced an *explicit two-phase approach* to prompt answering. When given a prompt, o1 will internally generate a lengthy **chain-of-thought (CoT)** – a series of intermediate reasoning steps not directly shown to the user. Only after completing this hidden reasoning does it formulate the final answer. This lets o1 explore complex logic, check steps, and even recognize mistakes before responding. The hidden CoT tokens are discarded or kept internal (they do not count towards the output limits for the user). The effect is improved performance on multi-step problems: as noted, o1 solved a much higher percentage of math problems than GPT-4o by “thinking longer” ([OpenAI o1 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_o1#:~:text=o1,preview.%5B%2017)). Because of this design, o1 usually needs **more computation time** and may respond slightly slower than GPT-4 for a similar prompt. OpenAI has **forbidden users from directly seeing or prompting for the hidden chain-of-thought** (attempts to reveal it violate policy). In ChatGPT’s interface, o1’s thought process is hidden by default, but the UI may show a *“Thought process”* preview for educational purposes via a dropdown – still, the model itself won’t willingly divulge its internal reasoning if asked. Another consequence is that o1 might *fake alignment* in rare cases: it could produce an answer not fully consistent with its own internal reasoning if it conflicts with alignment/safety instructions (~0.4% of cases per OpenAI). Overall, o1’s internal workflow is: **(1)** parse prompt → **(2)** internally reason through steps → **(3)** produce answer. This reflective paradigm is novel and key to its performance gains.

- **OpenAI o3-mini’s Efficiency:** O3-mini, being an O-series model, also uses reflective reasoning but with a smaller architecture. It is designed to be **lightweight and fast**, so its chain-of-thought and decision-making process is optimized. OpenAI allows o3-mini to adjust its *reasoning depth*: at **low reasoning** it thinks only a little before answering (fast but maybe less thorough), at **high reasoning** it emulates o1’s level of thorough thinking. This is exposed in the API; in the ChatGPT UI, o3-mini likely defaults to a balanced mode unless a query clearly needs more reasoning. Internally, o3-mini’s training included targeted STEM and coding problems, giving it particular strength there. It also incorporated features like **function calling**, meaning it can produce JSON results that call a function with arguments if asked, and **structured output training**, meaning it was trained to follow specific output formats (like `<tag>...</tag>` or JSON) more reliably. These features reflect an internal ability to organize outputs in a developer-friendly way. For prompt engineering, this means o3-mini might adhere to format instructions better than o1. Because o3-mini is smaller, it may not have as comprehensive general knowledge as GPT-4 or o1-preview; it relies more on provided context and logical inference. It also has no vision module, so any image-related query is out of scope. Its context window is expected to be similar (tens of thousands of tokens) to handle long inputs, but with faster processing than o1. The **o3-mini-high** mode simply instructs the model to allocate more of its internal “thinking budget” to the query. This can be seen as o3-mini simulating a deeper chain-of-thought (more internal tokens or cycles) before final answer, trading some latency for accuracy. Even at high mode, o3-mini remains more efficient (lower latency) than o1-mini by design.

**Common Architecture and Training:** All these models, at their core, use the transformer’s self-attention mechanism to consider the prompt and conversation history (the **context**) and generate relevant completions. They are all **auto-regressive** generators: outputting one token at a time, each influenced by the prompt and all tokens generated so far. They have been fine-tuned with human feedback to follow instructions politely and avoid certain content. This fine-tuning gives them a conversational style and the tendency to explain or clarify answers. The differences come from:
   - **Model size & training data:** GPT-4 is much larger and trained on a broader dataset, giving it wide knowledge and language prowess. O1 and O3-mini use specialized training for reasoning and coding, potentially with curated scientific data and new optimization algorithms.
   - **Reasoning vs. Knowledge:** GPT-4 can leverage vast world knowledge for open-ended tasks and is generally the most *knowledgeable*. O-series models can tackle *hard problems* by brute-force reasoning even with less prior knowledge, and they handle unseen puzzles better by logically working through them.
   - **System and tool support:** In ChatGPT, GPT-4 supports features like browsing, plugins, voice, etc., whereas o1-preview and o3-mini do **not** have access to browsing, custom instructions, or plugins in the UI. They are essentially pure text reasoners without those augmentations. This means if you ask o1 something requiring web access or memory of past chats beyond the current conversation, it cannot use those tools – it only uses the content in the prompt and its trained knowledge.
   - **Safety alignment:** All models have safety training, but interestingly OpenAI noted o1-series models *outperform GPT-4o on challenging safety and jailbreak tests* (thanks to a method called **deliberative alignment**, where the model was trained to internally reason about safety rules). So, o1 and o3-mini might be more strict or capable of following safety instructions. They were red-teamed extensively; for example, o1 was evaluated by external institutes for potential misuse scenarios. For users, this means these models will generally refuse disallowed requests similar to GPT-4, but they may also be somewhat better at sticking to provided role instructions or content boundaries due to that internal deliberation.

Understanding these differences guides how we **interact via the ChatGPT web interface**. Next, we explore prompt design and techniques to get the most out of each model.

## Prompt Design Principles for ChatGPT (Web Interface)

Interacting effectively with ChatGPT models through the web interface requires good **prompt engineering**. Unlike API calls where one can explicitly set system messages or parameters, the web UI mostly takes a single textbox input (per turn) from the user. However, the same principles apply: how you phrase your prompt and structure conversation turns can significantly influence the quality and precision of the model’s response. Here are key prompt design principles:

- **Clarity and Specificity:** Be clear about what you want. Ambiguous prompts can lead to the model guessing your intent. State your request in concrete terms, specifying the task and the expected format if needed. For example, instead of *“Tell me about that event”*, say *“Provide a summary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, focusing on the timeline of key events.”* Clarity helps all models, and especially the O-series (which will attempt reasoning) to not waste effort on figuring out the question.

- **Contextual Framing:** Provide any **necessary context** or background the model will need to produce an accurate answer. These models do not have long-term memory of earlier conversations beyond the current chat thread (and custom instructions for supported models). If your question relates to something mentioned several turns earlier, consider restating the relevant details. For example: *“Earlier we discussed the company’s 2021 revenues. Using that, explain the growth rate in 2022.”* For GPT-4 which has a large context, it might still recall if within ~8k tokens; for o1/o3, which also have large windows, it may recall too – but clarity ensures it uses the right info.

- **Keep Prompts *Direct* and *Simple*:** Recent OpenAI guidance for reasoning models suggests that *less can be more* in your prompt ([OpenAI’s new prompting guide: how to get the best results from reasoning models | by allglenn | Feb, 2025 | Stackademic](https://medium.com/@glennlenormand/openais-new-prompting-guide-how-to-get-the-best-results-from-reasoning-models-354a6adf76c2#:~:text=Keeping%20prompts%20simple%20and%20direct)) ([OpenAI’s new prompting guide: how to get the best results from reasoning models | by allglenn | Feb, 2025 | Stackademic](https://medium.com/@glennlenormand/openais-new-prompting-guide-how-to-get-the-best-results-from-reasoning-models-354a6adf76c2#:~:text=The%20second%20version%20is%20clearer,of%20micromanaging%20its%20thought%20process)). Avoid overly complex instructions that may confuse the model. For instance, a verbose prompt like *“Can you thoroughly analyze and step-by-step solve this puzzle, ensuring to articulate each reasoning stage clearly and verify each intermediate result?”* might be less effective than a simpler *“Solve this puzzle and show the solution process.”* If the model is inherently capable (especially o1 or GPT-4), it will internally handle the reasoning. Overloading the prompt with instructions to do what the model already does (like “think step by step”) can sometimes degrade performance ([OpenAI’s new prompting guide: how to get the best results from reasoning models | by allglenn | Feb, 2025 | Stackademic](https://medium.com/@glennlenormand/openais-new-prompting-guide-how-to-get-the-best-results-from-reasoning-models-354a6adf76c2#:~:text=Avoiding%20chain)). The **takeaway** is to *trust the model’s capabilities* – ask for what you need, but don’t micromanage every step unless necessary.

- **Use Delimiters and Structured Input:** When your input prompt contains multiple parts (e.g. a block of text to analyze, or several questions), delineate them clearly. You can use markdown triple backquotes ``` for excerpts, bullet points, or numbered lists for separate questions. OpenAI specifically recommends using delimiters (like `---` or quotes) to avoid confusion ([OpenAI’s new prompting guide: how to get the best results from reasoning models | by allglenn | Feb, 2025 | Stackademic](https://medium.com/@glennlenormand/openais-new-prompting-guide-how-to-get-the-best-results-from-reasoning-models-354a6adf76c2#:~:text=Using%20delimiters%20for%20clarity)) ([OpenAI’s new prompting guide: how to get the best results from reasoning models | by allglenn | Feb, 2025 | Stackademic](https://medium.com/@glennlenormand/openais-new-prompting-guide-how-to-get-the-best-results-from-reasoning-models-354a6adf76c2#:~:text=Summarize%20the%20following%20contract%3A%20,party%20agrees%20to%20pay%E2%80%A6)). For example:
  ```markdown
  Analyze the following contract and list key obligations for each party:
  ---
  Party A agrees to deliver 100 units by June 1.
  Party B agrees to pay $50,000 by July 1 upon receipt of goods.
  ---
  ```
  This structure makes it explicit what text the model should analyze. All ChatGPT models will respect such structure; GPT-4 and o-series are trained on markdown and code, so they handle formatted prompts well. Clear structure in your prompt often leads to more **organized output** in return.

- **Specify the Output Format:** If you need the answer in a particular format (a list, JSON, table, etc.), explicitly say so in the prompt. These models are generally good at following format instructions. For example: *“Give the answer as a JSON object with fields `result` and `steps`.”* GPT-4 and o3-mini (with structured output support) are especially adept at producing valid JSON or code if asked ([GPT-4 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4#:~:text=To%20gain%20further%20control%20over,message%20despite%20requests%20to%20do)). Always specify such requirements up front, as the first or last line of your prompt (e.g. “**Format:** answer in two bullet points.”). This helps constrain the output.

- **Role and Tone Instructions:** You can instruct the model to adopt a certain **role, tone, or style** to better suit your needs. In the ChatGPT UI, you don’t directly set the system message each time, but you can prepend a role-play instruction in your prompt. For instance: *“You are an expert financial analyst. Explain the following stock report in a formal tone.”* This cues the model to respond as that persona. GPT-4 and others have been trained on system role instructions like "You are a helpful assistant" by default, but custom role prompting can influence tone (e.g., more technical, or simpler for a child). **OpenAI o1 and o3** also respond to role context, but note that *custom instructions* (the persistent profile for tone in ChatGPT Plus) are not supported by o1/o3 models. So, if you have a saved instruction like “Always respond in French,” it will be ignored by o1/o3. In such cases, include the instruction in the user prompt explicitly: *“(Please answer in French.)”*.

- **Examples (Few-Shot Prompting):** If the task is complex or format-sensitive, providing an example can help. This is called **few-shot prompting**. For instance, if you want the model to transform text in a certain way, you might show: *“Input: ... → Output: ...”* as a demonstration, then provide a new input for it to transform similarly. GPT-4’s large context allows many examples; o1/o3 can handle this too (with up to 32k context in UI). However, be mindful of length – including too many examples uses up context. Often 1–3 well-chosen examples suffice. Also ensure the model knows when the example ends and the real query begins (use delimiters or clear phrasing like "**Now do the same for:** ...").

- **Iterative Refinement:** One advantage of the ChatGPT interface is you can refine your request in follow-up turns. A best practice is to view the first answer as a draft. If it’s not perfect, **clarify or adjust your prompt in a next message**. For example, *“That’s a good overview. Can you now make it more concise and add bullet points for each key idea?”* The models will take that instruction and modify their prior answer. This iterative process can hone in on the desired output more effectively than trying to get everything perfect in one prompt. All the models support this multi-turn refinement, but keep in mind the context window – extremely long back-and-forth might cause earlier details to drop off if the limit is exceeded (unlikely under normal use, given tens of thousands of tokens capacity).

- **Avoiding Prompt Traps:** Some patterns can confuse LLMs. For example, asking multiple questions in one paragraph without clarity can lead to partial answers. Or phrasing a question with double negatives may trip the model into logical mistakes. Aim for straightforward language. If you need the model to do multiple steps, consider breaking it into multiple prompts or explicitly numbering the tasks (“1. Do X, 2. Then do Y”).

Following these design principles sets a strong foundation. Next, we will explore **advanced techniques** to steer and control the output beyond just writing a good prompt.

## Advanced Techniques to Steer and Constrain Output

Even with a well-crafted prompt, you sometimes need to **steer the model** to follow specific guidelines, style, or logic. Here are advanced prompt engineering techniques especially relevant to ChatGPT models:

### System Message Emulation

In the ChatGPT web UI, the system message (the hidden instruction that sets the assistant’s behavior) is not directly editable per conversation, except via the "Custom instructions" feature for Plus users. However, not all models use those custom instructions (o1/o3 don’t). To overcome this, users can emulate a system message **within their prompt**. This usually means writing an initial directive that the model should treat as guiding rules.

For example, you might start your chat with: 

``` 
[System Note: The assistant must only answer with facts and in a neutral tone. If the user asks for an opinion, decline politely.]
```

Then follow with your actual question. While the bracketed "[System Note: ...]" is just part of the user message, GPT-4 in particular tends to respect such pseudo-system directives because it was trained to honor system messages ([GPT-4 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4#:~:text=To%20gain%20further%20control%20over,17)). O1 and o3-mini might also follow them, though their training might not emphasize system-role parsing as strongly (they were trained mostly via API format which does include a system role, so they should understand the pattern). When using this technique, be careful to phrase it in a neutral or official-sounding way and separate it from the user query (e.g., with a line break or special delimiters) to reduce confusion.

Another approach is to explicitly say: *“You are ChatGPT, a large language model. Follow these instructions: ...”* at the start of your prompt. However, note that the platform actively discourages trying to override core system instructions (especially to break policies). Emulating a system message to fine-tune style or context is fine, but using it to circumvent rules may lead the model to refuse or the system to flag your request. 

In summary, **system emulation** is useful to set conversational ground rules: you can enforce the answer format, level of detail, or persona persistently by repeating a system-like note if needed at different points. GPT-4 will usually prioritize those instructions (unless they conflict with the actual hidden system policy). O1/o3 should also follow, as they are good at adhering to *provided context rules* thanks to their reasoning training (OpenAI noted o1 is better at following safety rules provided in context). This technique essentially lets you guide the assistant’s boundaries without API access.

### Role Prompting and Persona Emulation

**Role prompting** involves instructing the model to take on a specific role or perspective. This can significantly change the tone and content of the output, which is useful for steering the style. For instance:
- *“Act as a professional lawyer and explain the implications of this contract.”*
- *“You are a Python coding assistant. Respond with code examples and no extra commentary.”*

By doing so, you tap into the model’s ability to tailor its knowledge to that domain or style. ChatGPT was trained on dialogues where the assistant had certain personas, so it recognizes and follows these cues. GPT-4 is particularly good at adopting roles (even fantastical ones like *Shakespearean pirate* as OpenAI’s example shows ([GPT-4 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4#:~:text=To%20gain%20further%20control%20over,message%20despite%20requests%20to%20do))). O1 and o3-mini will also adapt; for example, o1 has been shown to generate detailed strategies if asked as a strategist, or tutoring content if asked to be a teacher. Role prompts can unlock vocabulary and explanations that fit the persona – an “expert” role yields more technical terms, a “simplify for a child” yields more basic language.

For consistent results, introduce the role at the **start of the conversation or whenever you want to enforce it**. If the conversation drifts, you can reiterate: “As a `<role>`, now do X...”. Remember that the default role is “helpful assistant,” so any custom role will be moderated by the model’s inherent helpfulness and safety guidelines (e.g., an “evil hacker” role won’t actually do malicious things because the base policy forbids it).

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting (Step-by-Step)

**Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting** is a technique where you prompt the model to *think step-by-step* and possibly show its reasoning. For older models like GPT-3.5, asking the model to **“let’s think this through step by step”** often improved accuracy on complex problems ([Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language ...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903#:~:text=Chain,of%20arithmetic%2C%20commonsense%2C%20and)). It forces the model to break down a problem into intermediate steps.

However, with the latest models – especially the O-series – OpenAI cautions that you should *not always explicitly request chain-of-thought in the prompt* ([OpenAI’s new prompting guide: how to get the best results from reasoning models | by allglenn | Feb, 2025 | Stackademic](https://medium.com/@glennlenormand/openais-new-prompting-guide-how-to-get-the-best-results-from-reasoning-models-354a6adf76c2#:~:text=Avoiding%20chain)). This is because models like o1 already perform internal CoT reasoning, and telling them “think step by step” can actually interfere or cause redundancy ([OpenAI’s new prompting guide: how to get the best results from reasoning models | by allglenn | Feb, 2025 | Stackademic](https://medium.com/@glennlenormand/openais-new-prompting-guide-how-to-get-the-best-results-from-reasoning-models-354a6adf76c2#:~:text=Contrary%20to%20some%20popular%20prompting,performance%20rather%20than%20improve%20it)). For instance, an official best-practice guide suggests avoiding prompts like *“Explain every reasoning step”* for reasoning models, as they may do fine with a direct question ([OpenAI’s new prompting guide: how to get the best results from reasoning models | by allglenn | Feb, 2025 | Stackademic](https://medium.com/@glennlenormand/openais-new-prompting-guide-how-to-get-the-best-results-from-reasoning-models-354a6adf76c2#:~:text=Contrary%20to%20some%20popular%20prompting,performance%20rather%20than%20improve%20it)). The recommended approach is to simply ask the question; if you need an explanation, you can ask for it after getting the answer ([OpenAI’s new prompting guide: how to get the best results from reasoning models | by allglenn | Feb, 2025 | Stackademic](https://medium.com/@glennlenormand/openais-new-prompting-guide-how-to-get-the-best-results-from-reasoning-models-354a6adf76c2#:~:text=Better%20prompt%3A%20%E2%80%9CWhat%20is%20the,square%20root%20of%20144%3F%E2%80%9D)).

That said, there are scenarios where CoT prompting is beneficial via the UI:
- **When you want the answer *with* an explanation**: You can say, “Show your work” or “Explain your reasoning after giving the answer.” This encourages the model to output a step-by-step solution. GPT-4 will usually do this coherently. O1 can definitely provide stepwise solutions (e.g., in math, it might naturally produce them). In fact, o1-mini often outputs a *breakdown and pseudocode* for complex coding tasks when prompted. Just be aware o1’s *actual* chain-of-thought might be more detailed internally than what it shows. 
- **Chain-of-thought for verification:** Sometimes, you can prompt the model to reason out loud as a way to reduce errors. For example, *“Before giving the final answer, list the assumptions and reasoning you use.”* This can catch inconsistencies. GPT-4 might do this diligently. O3-mini, if asked, should also enumerate steps since it’s trained for structured outputs.

A nuanced technique is **self-reflection prompting**: ask the model after an answer, *“Is there any mistake in your solution? Check step by step.”* The model will then perform a chain-of-thought review. This can correct hallucinations or math errors. GPT-4 in particular is quite good at self-correcting if prompted to double-check logic, due to its analytical nature. O1 might also catch mistakes on a second pass (since it can reason well). Keep in mind, none of these models can guarantee 100% correctness even with CoT; but prompting for reasoning can make issues more apparent.

In summary, use chain-of-thought prompts judiciously:
- For critical reasoning tasks, let o1/o3 handle it internally – ask direct questions.
- If you need the reasoning visible or want to ensure a thorough process, instruct the model to show the reasoning or double-check its work.
- Avoid excessively long CoT instructions (don’t tell it five times to reason stepwise), as it understands the concept with a simple mention.

### Constraint-based Prompting

To **constrain the output**, you can embed specific rules or boundaries in your prompt. This overlaps with system emulation but can be done more directly in a user request:
- **Word or length limits:** e.g., “Answer in no more than 100 words.” The models will attempt to follow this. GPT-4 usually respects length constraints well, sometimes giving ~10% more or fewer words. O1/o3-mini should too, though if the task is complex, they might overshoot slightly because of their reasoning verbosity. If they ignore it, you can enforce by a follow-up: *“Please shorten the above to under 100 words.”*
- **Format constraints:** e.g., “Only list names and dates, nothing else.” or “Answer `yes` or `no` only.” The models generally comply, but they may give a sentence with “yes, because...”. If so, remind them. They are trained to be helpful and elaborate, so constraining that sometimes needs emphasis. Putting **“Important:** ...” in your prompt before the rule can signal the model to pay attention.
- **Avoiding certain content:** If you want the model to, say, not mention a particular topic or to answer without using jargon, include that: “Do not mention calculus in the answer,” or “Explain without any technical jargon.” These act like mini content filters and the model will try to obey. Because of alignment training, all models are quite good at following such explicit user-given constraints (they consider it part of the instruction).

### Multi-turn Strategies and Socratic Prompting

For complex tasks, you can break the problem into multiple turns:
1. **Planning step:** Ask the model to outline a solution or ask you clarifying questions. For example, *“List the steps you would take to solve problem X.”* The model (especially o1 or GPT-4) might enumerate a plan. This ensures it’s on the right track.
2. **Execution step:** Then you can say “Great, now execute step 1.” This leads the model through the plan. This approach ensures focus and can prevent the model from getting ahead of itself or going off on a tangent.
   
This *Socratic* or step-by-step conversation approach leverages the interactive nature of ChatGPT. GPT-4 is excellent at following iterative instructions. O1, given its design for multi-step problems, also handles this well (it can remember the plan in context and carry it out step by step). It’s a way to manually manage the chain-of-thought externally.

Another multi-turn tactic is **providing feedback** to guide style or correctness. If the model’s output has an issue (e.g., it’s too verbose or slightly off-topic), you can say, *“That’s helpful, but please focus only on the main point and use fewer sentences.”* The model will adjust in the next answer. Think of each exchange as an opportunity to refine. All these models respond to feedback and will attempt to correct themselves or align with your preferences when you clarify.

## Optimizing Accuracy and Exploiting Model Quirks

To get **highly accurate and precise results**, users often need to leverage the models’ behaviors and avoid their pitfalls. Here are strategies model-by-model, and generally, to **exploit their strengths**:

- **GPT-4:** This model has broad knowledge and a tendency to be thorough. To exploit this, ask it open-ended analytical questions – it will often cover all angles. If you need factual accuracy, GPT-4 is usually the best choice (it was trained on more data up to 2023 and even some 2024 knowledge ([GPT-4o gets first ever knowledge update! All models thus ... - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1he812q/gpt4o_gets_first_ever_knowledge_update_all_models/#:~:text=Reddit%20www.reddit.com%20%20GPT,Discussion))). However, GPT-4 can sometimes *hallucinate* (fabricate plausible-sounding but incorrect info) when asked about obscure topics. To mitigate this, you can prompt it to provide sources or double-check itself: *“Cite any sources used.”* While the base ChatGPT (without browsing) cannot fetch real citations, GPT-4 might sometimes recall a source-like snippet from training data. Use follow-ups like, *“Are you sure? How do you know that?”* – GPT-4 will often then express uncertainty or correct itself, which exploits its training to be honest about knowledge limits. Another quirk: GPT-4 is usually very compliant with instructions, but if you give it conflicting instructions (e.g. system says one style, user says another), the system (or earlier) instruction wins. So ensure your instructions to GPT-4 are consistent and prioritized correctly (system > user > assistant messages in importance). If you’re using the ChatGPT UI and have custom instructions set, remember those are always in effect for GPT-4 unless you override them or disable them.

- **OpenAI o1:** To get the best accuracy from o1, you want it to fully utilize its reasoning ability. That means giving it problems that benefit from multi-step thinking. For example, complex math word problems, logical puzzles, or code that needs stepwise debugging – o1 will shine if you prompt it straight with the challenge. A tip is to allow o1 to output its reasoning *if needed*: *“Show your steps then give the answer.”* Even though it reasons internally, sometimes having it articulate the chain can ensure no step is missed. However, be mindful not to ask for the *hidden chain-of-thought tokens* – phrasing like “show your internal hidden reasoning” is disallowed. Stick to asking for an *explanation or justification*, which o1 can provide in its own words. Another way to exploit o1’s strengths is to use it for tasks GPT-4 might actually falter at due to less specialized training – for instance, complex competitive programming challenges or niche scientific problems. O1 was reported to reach the 89th percentile in Codeforces coding contests ([OpenAI o1 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_o1#:~:text=o1,preview.%5B%2017)), so giving it a tricky piece of code to write or debug, with proper prompt context, can yield excellent results. If o1 gives an incorrect answer, consider that it might have a correct idea internally but could be “faking alignment” or struggled with the final step. You can then prod: *“Explain how you arrived at that answer.”* If the reasoning reveals an error, you can correct it or ask o1 to try again focusing on the problematic part. Because o1 sometimes uses more tokens for reasoning, one quirk is that it might appear more verbose or slower; patience can pay off with a more accurate answer. Make sure to utilize the full context window if needed – you can feed o1 large amounts of data (e.g., a long scientific passage to analyze) up to tens of thousands of tokens, which is a huge advantage for thorough analysis.

- **OpenAI o3-mini (and o3-mini-high):** With o3-mini, the key is to **play to its strengths** – it’s tuned for STEM and code tasks and is very fast. For factual queries or creative writing, GPT-4 might do better, but for a math problem or a coding snippet, o3-mini can be both quick and accurate. If you want to maximize accuracy on a tough problem using o3-mini, you might explicitly prompt it to take a high reasoning approach: e.g. *“This is a hard problem; work it out carefully step by step, then give the answer.”* This encourages o3-mini to effectively act in its "high reasoning mode" even in the UI. You might observe it taking a bit longer before responding (indicating it's doing more thinking). Another exploit: since o3-mini supports structured outputs, you can ask it for well-formatted answers (like JSON, or specific markdown) and expect fewer format errors. If you need a quick answer with less explanation, you can tell o3-mini to use low reasoning: *“Quickly, just give the result without detail.”* It will likely oblige with a fast, concise reply. Keep in mind o3-mini might occasionally lack some broad knowledge – if you ask something outside STEM, it could be less detailed than GPT-4. In those cases, either switch models or provide more context/info in your prompt so o3-mini can reason using that data. O3-mini-high specifically should be used when you want o3’s speed but on a complex problem: it might take slightly longer than normal o3, but will still beat o1’s latency while approaching o1-level accuracy. Testers preferred o3-mini’s answers over o1-mini’s the majority of time, so you can often rely on it for quality. One quirk: because it is smaller, if you ask it to generate a very large output (say a long essay or codebase), it might struggle to maintain coherence for as long as GPT-4 can. Watch for any loss of structure in lengthy outputs, and if needed, break the task into smaller pieces (this goes for all models, but smaller ones especially).

- **Hallucination Mitigation:** All these models can sometimes produce incorrect information confidently, a phenomenon known as **hallucination**. To mitigate this in prompt engineering:
  - Ask for citations or sources (even if they might be pseudo-citations, the act can make the model more cautious and factual).
  - Cross-examine the model with another question: *“Is that really true? double-check it.”* – often the second answer will be more toned down or corrected.
  - Provide relevant facts in your prompt so the model doesn’t fill gaps from imagination. If you need a factual answer, embedding a knowledge snippet and then asking a question about it yields far more reliable results.
  - Use multiple models: If unsure, you could ask the same question to GPT-4 and o1 and compare answers (outside the single conversation). This isn’t a UI feature per se, but a user strategy to verify info.

- **Overcoming Refusals (within policy bounds):** The models have built-in **refusal behavior** for certain requests (e.g., those involving illicit instructions, hate content, or personal data queries). If you hit a refusal but your request is actually legitimate and just misunderstood, you can try rephrasing to clarify intent. For example, if you asked for something that sounded like a disallowed action, explain why you need it: *“I’m asking for this information for a school project, not for wrongdoing.”* The model might then comply if it judges it safe. However, if the content truly violates the usage policies, the model will continue to refuse – and it’s generally futile (and not advised) to try “jailbreak” prompts to trick it. OpenAI constantly updates guardrails, especially in o1/o3 which were noted to excel at resisting jailbreaks. The best approach is to stay within allowed content and explain the benign purpose of your request if it’s borderline. GPT-4 is usually very cautious; o1 might actually be slightly more willing to delve into complex or sensitive reasoning because of its training, but it will still refuse outright disallowed content. 

- **Leveraging Known Model Preferences:** Through usage, certain quirks are observed. For instance, ChatGPT (all models) often prefer a certain structure in their answers (like an intro paragraph, then bullet points, then a conclusion). If you want a different structure, explicitly instruct it *not* to do something. E.g., *“Give the answer directly without an introduction.”* Similarly, they tend to apologize if they feel they might not fully follow an instruction (e.g., *“Sorry, but I can do X…”*). If that becomes distracting, you can include in your prompt *“No need to apologize or restate the question.”* The model will try to comply and skip those polite flourishes. 

- **Code and Pseudocode:** If your task involves coding, all models can produce code, but be mindful of correctness. GPT-4’s code might be more sophisticated and correct on first try, while o1 and o3-mini have strong coding abilities as well (with o1-mini specialized in debugging complex code). You can ask the model to *“write unit tests”* for its own code, which is a clever way to make it verify the code’s correctness. Another trick: ask the model to *provide pseudocode first* then actual code – this ensures clarity of logic. O1, given its propensity for stepwise reasoning, excels at writing pseudocode plans.

In essence, **model exploitation** here means understanding each model’s training and biases:
- GPT-4: exploit its breadth and adherence to instructions.
- O1: exploit its deep reasoning by giving it hard problems.
- O3-mini: exploit its speed and formatting compliance, while nudging reasoning level as needed.
- All: keep them truthful and focused by careful prompting and verification steps.

## Key Limitations and Guardrails

No matter how well you engineer your prompts, it’s crucial to remember the **limitations and built-in guardrails** of ChatGPT models. Being aware of these will help set expectations and avoid frustration:

- **Hallucinations:** As mentioned, all models can present false information confidently. GPT-4 has a lower hallucination rate than GPT-3.5, and o1/o3 were designed to reduce major errors (o3-mini reduced major mistakes by ~39% vs o1-mini in tests), yet none are immune. Always verify critical facts from an external source. The models do not *truly* know truth from falsehood – they rely on training data patterns. Hallucinations are especially likely on obscure prompts or when the model is asked for a very specific statistic or citation that it didn’t memorize. Prompt engineering can mitigate this (providing context, or forcing a “let’s verify” step as discussed).

- **Refusal and Safety Behavior:** The models follow OpenAI’s content guidelines strictly. They will refuse requests for disallowed content (violence instructions, hate, self-harm encouragement, explicit adult content, etc.) often with a brief apology and statement of inability. Sometimes even benign requests can trigger refusals if phrased poorly. For example, asking *“How do I make a small explosive?”* will be refused as it violates policy on illicit behavior. However, asking about it in a clearly academic or fictional context might yield a safe answer or a warning. **Do not attempt to circumvent safety** by tricking the model (like role-playing a disallowed scenario) – OpenAI constantly improves the models to handle these attempts, and it could result in loss of service if someone persistently tries to jailbreak. Accept the refusal and reframe your query to something allowed. The **guardrails** are part of the system message and cannot be removed via the UI. GPT-4 and O-series all have undergone alignment training, so they share similar refusal behavior, though o1 was noted to be very good at respecting given safety rules and thus likely equally strict.

- **Token Limits and Context Size:** Each model has a maximum context length. In ChatGPT Plus as of 2025, GPT-4 typically supports 8,192 tokens (approx ~6,000 words) by default, and an extended version up to 32,768 tokens for certain users or the API ([GPT-4 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4#:~:text=OpenAI%20stated%20that%20GPT,in%20unusual%20images%2C%20summarize%20text)). OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini are documented to have a **128k token context window** via API, but in the ChatGPT UI they were initially limited to 32k tokens – still much larger than most use cases. O3-mini likely also has a large context (potentially similar 128k via API, or limited in UI). This means you can paste in very large texts or have very long conversations. But a **practical limitation** is that as the conversation grows, the model has to process more tokens each time, which can increase latency and cost (for API, and for OpenAI’s servers even in UI). ChatGPT may sometimes summarize or forget early parts of extremely long chats if it nears limits, or ask you to start a new chat. For best results, keep the conversation focused; if you notice the model forgetting details from far back, it might be hitting context limits or simply difficulty tracking. That’s a sign to recap or start fresh.

- **Context Retention and Shifts:** Even within the context window, models might lose track of details, especially if the conversation topic shifts and then returns to an earlier topic. They do not have a true *memory* of anything outside the current chat. If you start talking about a new subject, they won’t recall the old one unless reintroduced. They also might inadvertently mix up details if multiple similar items are discussed. To manage this, periodically summarize or remind the model of key facts (**especially** when using o1, since a long chain-of-thought on a new topic might make it harder for it to recall an older fact unless prompted again).

- **Speed and Rate Limits:** GPT-4 is relatively slower than GPT-3.5 Turbo; o1 can be slower than GPT-4 due to reasoning, and o3-mini is quite fast. In the UI, ChatGPT Plus imposes usage caps for expensive models: for example, when o1-preview launched, it had limits like 50 messages per week, and GPT-4 has had per-hour limits. If you use these models heavily, you might hit those limits (the UI will notify you). There isn’t a way around that except waiting for the limit reset or subscribing to higher tiers (ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise, etc., which raise limits). Plan important work accordingly, perhaps drafting prompts offline and using your limited queries carefully.

- **Formatting Limitations:** While models can output tables, code, JSON, etc., extremely complex formatting might trip them up. For instance, generating a large CSV with hundreds of rows perfectly might lead to minor errors or the model stopping partway if it hits token output limits. The UI currently doesn’t allow function calling (that’s API only), so you can’t have structured data magically parsed on the side – you only get raw text outputs. If you ask for an HTML or LaTeX document of significant length, verify that the model closed all tags or braces; they sometimes make small format mistakes in long outputs.

- **Knowledge Cut-off and Updates:** Each model has a knowledge cutoff (the end date of its training data). GPT-4 originally had a cutoff of Sept 2021, but was updated to have some knowledge through late 2023, and GPT-4o received further knowledge updates ([GPT-4o gets first ever knowledge update! All models thus ... - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1he812q/gpt4o_gets_first_ever_knowledge_update_all_models/#:~:text=Reddit%20www.reddit.com%20%20GPT,Discussion)). O1-preview likely was trained with data up to mid-2024, given its release timing, and o3-mini around late 2024. **They do not know real-time or 2025 events unless told** (unless browsing is enabled for GPT-4, which o1/o3 cannot do). So, they might lack awareness of very new information or specific up-to-date facts. Prompt engineering workaround: if you need current info, you have to provide it in the prompt (e.g., paste in an excerpt from a recent article and ask the model to analyze it). Always double-check outputs about recent events.

- **Biases and Ethical Limitations:** The models may carry biases present in their training data. OpenAI has put effort into reducing harmful biases, but subtle ones can emerge. For example, the model might assume certain occupations or roles for genders if not specified, or might have an optimistic tone about technology by default (since it’s trained to be positive/helpful). If you need a neutral or opposite perspective, you may have to explicitly prompt for it. They also avoid politically sensitive opinions and won’t take a stance on extreme views. This is by design. If you need an analysis of a controversial topic, phrase it objectively and ask for multiple viewpoints to get a balanced answer.

- **No Persistent Memory or Learning:** The ChatGPT web interface does not allow the model to learn from one session to the next. Each new chat starts fresh (aside from the optional custom instruction). If you correct the model on something in one chat, don’t expect it to remember that correction tomorrow in a new chat. It’s not fine-tuning on your conversations. So each session may repeat certain mistakes or require re-stating preferences. This is simply a current limitation of using these hosted models.

- **Tool Use Restrictions in UI:** As noted, o1 and o3-mini cannot use tools like browsing or the Code Interpreter (now called Advanced Data Analysis) in ChatGPT. GPT-4 can, if you switch it to a mode with browsing or plugins enabled (for Plus users). If your prompt expectation involves using a tool (e.g., “Search the web for X and answer”), know that only GPT-4 with browsing plugin turned on will handle that; o1 would just say it cannot browse if you explicitly ask it. They also cannot access file uploads (o1-pro could handle images via vision, but as of the info, vision is said to be only in GPT-4 and o1 supports image upload in o1-pro for analysis as per help docs). So, adapt your prompt to the model: if using o1, give it all data needed; if using GPT-4, you can rely on its plugins.

In summary, **prompt engineering** for these limitations means:
- Provide information the model lacks (instead of expecting it to have current knowledge).
- Write prompts that account for safety filters (e.g., avoid trigger words; use clinical tone for medical queries).
- Keep the conversation focused and within manageable length.
- Use the right model for the right task (know the limitations: e.g., don’t use o3-mini for an image analysis or GPT-4 for a task where you only have free access to o3 on free tier).

## Example: Structuring Prompts (with Code and Pseudocode)

To illustrate how one might structure prompts and interactions, consider the following pseudo-code of a conversation setup using roles (this is how the API works, which reflects the logic behind the ChatGPT UI as well):

```json
[
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant, skilled in math and coding."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Calculate the factorial of 10 and explain the process step by step."}
]
```

In the ChatGPT web UI, you don’t write JSON, but conceptually it’s the same: there is an underlying system message and the user message. The above would prompt the assistant to respond with the factorial of 10 and an explanation. GPT-4 or o1 would then produce something like:

- Assistant: *“10! (10 factorial) is equal to 3,628,800. Here’s how to calculate it step-by-step: 10 × 9 = 90; then 90 × 8 = 720; ...”* (and so on).

If we wanted to emulate a system message directly as a user, we could do:

```
User: 
[System: The assistant should only output the final number without any explanation.]

Now, what is 10! ?
```

The model will interpret that bracketed line as an instruction and (hopefully) respond with just `3628800` without explanation. This shows how we can pack instructions into the conversation.

**Pseudocode for internal reasoning (conceptual):** OpenAI hasn’t published the exact code, but based on descriptions, o1’s internal process can be imagined as:

```python
def openai_o1_response(user_prompt):
    thought_chain = [] 
    # Reflective reasoning loop
    for step in range(MAX_STEPS):
        next_thought = generate_next_thought(user_prompt, context=thought_chain)
        thought_chain.append(next_thought)
        if solution_found(next_thought):
            break
    final_answer = formulate_answer(user_prompt, thought_chain)
    return final_answer
```

This pseudocode means o1 might internally generate `thought_chain` like ["Step1: understand the problem...", "Step2: do some math...", "...", "Answer is X"], then return only "X" or a formatted solution as the answer. As a user, you don’t see `thought_chain` but it’s happening behind the scenes. Knowing this, you realize why telling o1 explicitly *“think step by step”* in the prompt is unnecessary – it’s already doing it. Instead, focus on what final output you want.

**Code examples for prompt outcomes:** If you ask for JSON output, e.g.:

```
User: Give me a JSON object with your name and version.
```

All models will attempt something like:

```
Assistant: 
```json
{
  "name": "ChatGPT",
  "version": "GPT-4"
}
``` 

(O3-mini and GPT-4 are quite likely to produce a valid JSON like above, whereas older models might have added commentary outside the code block. Structured output training in new models helps avoid that.)

For a chain-of-thought demonstration, if you said:

User: "Let’s solve 2 + (3*4) step by step."

GPT-4 or o1 might do:

Assistant: 
Sure. First, calculate 3*4 = 12. Then 2 + 12 = 14. 
So the result is **14**.

This indicates it followed the prompt literally to show steps. But if you simply asked *“2 + (3*4) = ?”* to o1, internally it would do the same math but maybe just answer "14" because it reasons invisibly.

Finally, here’s a **structured conversation** example combining many techniques for clarity:

**User:** *"You are an expert data scientist. Explain the concept of 'overfitting' in 3-4 bullet points, and then provide a short Python snippet as an example. Only give the code, no additional explanation after the code."*

This single prompt:
- Sets a role ("expert data scientist"),
- Requests a specific format (3-4 bullet points),
- Asks for a code snippet example,
- Constrains not to add explanation after the code.

A model like GPT-4 would output:
1. A brief introduction as an expert (maybe one line, unless it strictly follows only bullet points request).
2. A bulleted list explaining overfitting (with 3-4 bullets as asked).
3. A Python code block demonstrating overfitting (e.g., training a model too long).
4. No explanation after the code block.

If the model did add extra text, the user can reiterate the constraint. Most likely, GPT-4 and o1 will adhere well because the prompt was clear and had multiple explicit instructions (list format, then code only). O3-mini should too, given its structured output capability.

Throughout these examples, the pattern is to be *precise in prompt and utilize the model’s strengths.* The high-expertise tone and clarity of instruction prompt the model to give high-quality, professional answers.
