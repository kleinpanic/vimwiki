# 24/7 Underwater Livestream Cameras

Explore the ocean depths and coastal reefs through these continuously operating underwater livestreams. Streams are grouped by **stationary deep-sea cameras**, **mobile deep ocean expeditions**, and **shallow natural marine environments**. Each entry includes a brief description and a direct link to the live feed. All listed streams are non-aquarium, natural habitat cameras (with priority on deep-sea sites). Enjoy round-the-clock views of marine life, from hydrothermal vents to coral reefs, and remember many deep-sea expedition streams run 24/7 **during missions**. 

## Stationary Deep-Sea Cameras

- **Ocean Networks Canada – Endeavour Hydrothermal Vent Field (NEPTUNE Observatory):** A cabled seafloor camera ~2,300 m below the surface at the Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, streaming views of active hydrothermal chimneys and their unique vent fauna (giant tube worms, bacterial mats, etc.) ([Get to Know the 5 Regions of ONC’s Cabled Observatory | Nautilus Live](https://nautiluslive.org/blog/2023/06/27/get-know-5-regions-oncs-cabled-observatory#:~:text=Perhaps%20the%20most%20famous%20of,chimneys%20hosting%20unique%20ecological%20communities)).
