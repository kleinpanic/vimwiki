# ScreenRecorder

- Migrate to C?
- Learn python binaries as an alternative. 
- GH repo setup 
- Ability to recorder frame buffer or non gui screens 
- Make sure audio codec and video codec return shit and same with resolution. 
- Make gui prettier 
- Add cli counterpart with fork 
- Resize on turning on camera 
- Duration does not return meaningful information in realtime 
- Resolution does not return meaningful information in realtime 
	- Same with the codec
- Tkinter framing is pretty shitty. 
- Possible dynamic recording resolution option? 
- Duration, Resolution, and codecs return meaningful info post recording. 
- No great way to end the program / exit it.
	- make sure to do graceful exits
- Control C freezes program, and does keyboard interrupt lock
