## Lecture 2 
- Vectors
    - "Magnitude and direction"
    - An element in a vector field
    - Can be manipulated graphically or algebraically
        - Choose a convient coordinate system
        - Break all vectors down into components
            - Dependent upon the coordinate system, and the vector, it can be broken down into it's consistent parts. 
                - Ax=|A|cos(Theta)
                - Ay=|A|sin(Theta)
                - |A|=Sqrt(Ax^2 + Ay^2 )
                - Theta = Arctan (Ay/Ax)
        - Do all operations in component form
        - If required, convert the answer back to a vector (Mag and Dir)
    - Position of a particle with respect to an observe is a Vector Rho-Arroy(t). 
- Scalors
    - Magnitude without a direction.
