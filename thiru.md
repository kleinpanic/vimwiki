## Freshman Year
- Big friend group when in freshman year. Went to DPS (frat). He was super drunk, needed support getting back home. He was trying to grab someone's hand. Servani's hand was grabbed, but she told him he doesn't like him like that. He went back to his dorm after that. He talked to his RA's and he said she had spoken to them but the RA's didn't do anything with the school. There was a rumor he moved out, but he did not. 
- People involved have come forth and apologized for spreading this misinformation apparantly. This was all freshman year. 
- Impacted his mental health heavily. 

## Formals at Myrtl
- She kissed him. She did not remember for two days apparantly. 
  
## Summer
- He visited for a weekend. Him and a couple other people came to the frat house. Everyone else went DT. It was Him, Sri, Dom, and servani came. They were just drinking and chilling. He says "I guess we were flirting". He gave his apartment keys to Sri over the summer. Servani and him got an uber. She ended up "taking him home". As soon as he went home "he passed out". He woke up early morning and he had to piss really bad. He pissed and went back to bed and took his pants off and back on. Him and Servani woke up later. He was sleeping at Servani that night (bc he didn't have apartment keys). They were making out in the morning. He made a move, she started crying, he backed off, "do you wanna talk about it", "whats going on". She claimed it was something personal with her. HE was talking, trying to get to know her. 40 mins later, making out again, end up having sex. Finished, talking normally still. Topics: "Studying for Lsat", "getting to know eachother (in his words)". She offers to drive him home, he said he can uber, she drove him home. He went to sri's apartment, walked in, and passed out on the couch in center. 
- Next day: got a call from Ryan. Went and hungout, got food, that night, hungout at pool (retreat). They were talking, nothing was weird then (according to him). Talked for a while while others were playing pool. Ryan wanted to go to bed, so Thiru called it a night. They were gonna dispurse, he told sri if he stays thiru will say. They smoke at Servani's. She offers to drive them both home. She did. Sri and Thiru went to waffle house, and got food.
- A couple days later, she texted him (didn't have her number save). "we need to talk". They call, and talk. Generally, it was a one sides convo, she is saying that she was really drunk the next morning (that they had sex), and she said "she didn't like that". She said "no thiru it is my time to talk". Read text logs. "If you don't call youre going to have a bigger issue thiru" (Sirvani). 

## Extra
- Sex was around 8-10. Talked an hour and a half before sex. 
- They ended up sleeping in the same bed because she didn't direct him to the couch. He says he went up, and passed out, fully clothed the whole time until they had sex.
- "Make a move" = going lower with his hands. His pants were off, and she started crying. "Let's back up", he puts his pants back on, and they talked, and then progressed again, and then they had sex. 
- "Foreskin was not pulled back". He was clothed, no signs of sex. He says she said they DID not have sex that night, and she was glad (Along those lines - or rather he felt they came to the mutual conclusion of such). 
- Phone call: She said that she was uncomfortable that she was possibly enibriated. This was 2 days AFTER calling and talkign with dom, and claimg she was raped by him. 
- He had a phone call when he was in san fran by Sri saying that she claimed elsewise. 

# Sirvani
## From Dom
- That night they were at the house, the yere drinking, they had gone home. She had gone upstairs, thiru went upstairs, she was like "Oh whatever". Essentially they were in the bed, "talked for a little", she says "he made a move", it got to a point to where it was progressing, and she didn't want to. She was crying THAT night. In the morning it happened again, and she said he said "I hope you don't cry this time". 
- Sex happened twice, once in night, and once in morning. 
- She apparantly does not want to press charged because she is in lsat studying and in sorotieis. She is claiming that this is now affecting her day to day life? She is hurt by it, and she doesn't want Thiru around anymore. 
- She is claiming that during this past saturday, he apparently went out and talked to her. He was entirely sober for that and he claims otherwise. He knew what was going on and he was trying to avoid her (From him). When he saw her walk in, danny and alan talked to her but Thiru stayed back. Ryan will vouch for his sobrity.
- "covered Her mouth", "made a comment about last night", 
- "Not every girl is like this, and you might get reported..."
- "Last time you wanted me to tell you, you wanted me to tell you"
- "Friday night"... "The morning was a complete blur to me and i think we both know that the vibe just wasnt there"
- "I told you this had happened to me before"...
- July 2nd was the phone call with thiru, weekend before he visited. 7:52pm, east coast it was 10:52pm. Sri apparently knows August 19.
