# Multi-media Encoding and Decoding formats, and Multi-media container storage types

## Codecs and Endecs:

### General Background:

A codec is hardware or software component(s) that encode or decodes a dat astream or signal. Codec is a portmanteau of coder/decoder. 

In electronic communications, an endec is a device that acts as both an encoder and a decoder on a signal or data stream, and hence is a type of cdec. Endec is a portmanteau of encoder/decoder.

A coder or encoder encodes a data stream or a signal for transmission or storage, possible in encrypted form, and the decoder function reverses the encoding for playback or editing. Codecs are used in video streams. 


### History of Codecs / Endecs: 

### Compression 

In addition to encoding a signal, a codec may also compress the data to reduce transmission bandwidth or storage space. Compression codecs are classified primarily into Lossy codecs and Lossless codecs. 
Lossles codecs are often used for archiving data in compressed form while retaining all of the information present in the original stream. If preserving the original quality of the stream is more important than eliminating the correspondingly larger data sizes, lossless codecs are preferred. This is especially true if the data is to undergo further data processing (ie editing) in which case the repeated application of processing (encoding and decoding) on lossy codecs will degrade the quality of the resulting data such that it is no longer identifiable 9visually, audibly, and or both). Using more than one docec or encoding scheme successively can also degrade quality significantly. The decreasing cost of storage capacity and network bandwidth has a tendency to reduce the need for lossy codecs and or some media.
