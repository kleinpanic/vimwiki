# Programming language
- A system of a notation for writing computer programs
- They are described in terms of their syntax and usually defined by a formal language. Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables, and mechanisms for error handling. 
## Definitions
- Domain and Target: 
  - A programing language involves a computer, consequently programming languages are usually defined and studied this way. They differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interactions between people, programming languages allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.
  - The domain of the language is considerable. Markup languages like XML, HTML, or troff, which define strucutred data, are not usually considered programming languages. Programming languages, may, however share the syntax with markup languages if a computiational semantics is defined, XSLT, for example is a turing complete language using XML syntax. 
- Abstractions:
    - Programming languages contain abstractions for defining and manipulating data structures or controlling the flow of execution. The practical necessity that a programming language supports adequate abstractions is expressed by the abstraction principle. This principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions. 
## Elements
All programming languages have some primitive building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them (like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection). These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively. 
- Syntax: The programming languages surface form
  - Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. on the other hand, some programming languages are more graphical, usuing visual relationships between symbols to specify a program. The syntax of a language describes the possible combos of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handleds by semantics (formal or hard-coded in a reference implementation.).
