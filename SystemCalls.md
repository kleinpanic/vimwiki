# System Calls 

## Overview 

- a System call (abbreviated to syscall) is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the Operating system on which it is exected. This may include hardware-related services, creation, and execution of new processes, and communication with integral kernel services such as process scheduling. System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system. 
- In most systems, system calls can only be made from userspace processes, while in some systems, OS/360 and successros, for example, priviledged system codes also issues system calsl. 
- For embedded systems, system calls typically do not chnge the priviledge mode of the CPU.
